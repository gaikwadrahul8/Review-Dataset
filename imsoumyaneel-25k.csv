"It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food .",neutral
Can you give me some examples ?,neutral
Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy .,neutral

Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool .,neutral
"Ah , here we are .",neutral
This is the place I was telling you about .,neutral

I don't know how to say it in English .,neutral
We call this a ' parking meter ' .,neutral
"Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ?",neutral
P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r .,neutral
Would you mind giving me a hand ?,neutral
"Okay , Bob , What is it ?",neutral
"Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ?",neutral
All right .,neutral
"Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please .",neutral
"Yes , here you are .",neutral
There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight .,neutral
"Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid .",neutral
"Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ?",neutral
You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ?,neutral
Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise .,negative
I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition .,neutral
What's that ?,neutral
You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .,neutral

Certainly .,neutral
How much will I have to pay ?,neutral
"Two yuan , please .",neutral
Here are the letter and the money .,neutral
Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it .,neutral
Is it overweight ?,neutral
I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan .,negative
All right . Here is the money .,neutral
Here are the stamps and your receipt .,neutral
What shall I do with the receipt ?,neutral
You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive .,neutral

That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food .,neutral
"We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .",neutral
Why don't we do that anymore ?,neutral
"Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot .",neutral
Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?,neutral
"Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .",neutral
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?,neutral
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .,neutral
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .,neutral
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .,neutral
"Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .",neutral
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .,neutral

Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .",neutral
"There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?",neutral
200 dollars per week .,neutral
"In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .",neutral
"It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .",neutral
"Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .",neutral
Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ?,neutral
I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?,neutral
Twice a week for work and once for shopping .,neutral
"In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .",neutral
"That's true . Ok , I will think about it .",neutral

No problem . Wait for a moment .,positive
Can I help you ?,neutral
I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ?,neutral
Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food .,neutral
Moon cakes ? What is that ?,neutral

Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people .,positive
"All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style .",neutral
What's the difference between these two styles ?,neutral

I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .,neutral
"Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .",neutral
"Ann , it's terrible !",negative
What's up ?,neutral
"Look , this is a pimple !",neutral
"Oh , I think it is .",neutral
How come ?,neutral
I think it's because of your bad habits !,negative
"I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .",neutral
"I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .",neutral
I wasn't aware of that !,positive
You should do better later .,neutral

I see .,neutral
But thank you very much all the same .,neutral
Sorry I couldn't help you .,negative

"Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .",negative
"Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .",neutral
"Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .",negative
"In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?",neutral
That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?,neutral
That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you .,neutral
What is this big box at the front door ?,neutral
Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print .,neutral
What did you get yourself into ?,neutral
I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months .,neutral
"So , what's in the box ? A fridge ?",neutral
It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .,neutral
"I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you !",neutral
Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ?,neutral
What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .,neutral
I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .,negative
Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ?,neutral
He is really outrageous .,negative
What happened ?,neutral
"I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .",neutral
What ? He can't do this to you .,positive
"Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .",negative
What did you do ?,neutral
I shouted it back of course .,negative
"Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?",neutral
What would you do if you were in my shoes ?,neutral
"Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .",neutral
"No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .",negative
"I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .",neutral
I am too angry to do that .,negative
How can I help you ?,neutral

Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .,neutral
"It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy .",neutral
How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .,neutral
She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .,neutral
How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .,neutral
"No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .",neutral
I know what she would like-some whitening cream .,neutral
"No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .",neutral
Will that be all then ?,neutral
"That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks .",positive
"Good morning , madam . Can I help you ?",neutral
I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ?,neutral
Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel .,neutral
Anything that can keep my skin clean will do .,neutral
How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy .,neutral
"Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance .",neutral
"We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it .",neutral
I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ?,neutral
"Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic .",neutral

What did you buy at the market ?,neutral
I bought some special local products .,neutral
You seem to have bought the whole market !,positive
"Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut .",neutral
Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals .,neutral
Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ?,neutral
"All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes .",neutral
Then I will buy some tomorrow .,neutral
Why do you want to buy so much ?,neutral
Because I want to send them to my friends .,neutral
I see .,neutral
Are there pets allowed in this apartment ?,neutral
"No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed .",neutral
What about a boa constrictor ?,neutral
Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ?,neutral
"If I had one , could I rent this apartment ?",neutral
I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock .,neutral
What about a Gila monster ?,neutral
"I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here .",neutral
"Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams .",neutral
Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ?,neutral
I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one .,neutral
You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ?,neutral
"I know , I know . I will do it all by myself .",neutral
Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ?,neutral
Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already .,neutral
Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this .,positive

That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ?,neutral
I'm afraid that's the best we can do .,negative
"If so , I'd better try another store .",negative
"So how far is the museum , dad ?",neutral

Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ?,neutral
"Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket .",neutral
Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office .,neutral
I need some flowers for my girlfriend .,neutral
No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?,neutral
"Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion .",neutral
How much did you want to spend ?,neutral
Money is no object .,neutral
Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .,neutral
I will take ten .,neutral
Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now .,neutral
Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?,positive
"Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .",neutral
That's ok . Here is the address .,neutral
What can I do for you ?,neutral
Can I have a look at your handworks ?,neutral
"All right . This way , please .",neutral

Could you please select me one ?,neutral
How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful .,neutral
"Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ?",neutral
350 yuan .,neutral
OK . I'll take it .,positive
"Dad , do you know where Mom is ?",neutral
I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you .,neutral
She'd better not start crying like she usually does .,neutral
"I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ?",neutral
"Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me .",neutral
I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world .,neutral
That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks .,positive
We have great confidence in you .,positive
"Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it !",positive
That is a blast from the past .,neutral
Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ?,neutral
Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .,neutral
"Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom .",neutral
But what are you going to do with that pig ?,neutral
I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money .,neutral
"Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation !",positive
Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets .,neutral
It still feels really strange to me .,neutral
I know . I miss him terribly .,neutral
How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ?,neutral
I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury .,neutral
I guess you could choose that if you wanted .,neutral
"No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did .",neutral
Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone !,positive

Thanks for noticing .,positive
What type of diet were you on ?,neutral
"I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .",neutral
That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?,positive
"Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .",neutral
"That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?",neutral
"Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .",neutral
That makes sense . I'm going to try that .,neutral
You don't need to lose weight .,neutral
I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .,neutral
Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .,neutral
Thanks for the advice .,positive
No problem .,positive
"Nancy , please turn the TV down .",neutral

Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ?,neutral
I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely .,neutral
He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .,neutral
"Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him .",neutral
How do you propose to help him understand that ?,neutral
"Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends .",neutral
I guess we could go visit once in a while too .,neutral

No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ?,neutral
I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ?,neutral
That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more .,neutral
He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .,neutral
"Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake .",neutral
"You're glad he saved me , huh ?",neutral
Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time !,positive
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .,positive
"Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet .",neutral
Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .,neutral
"That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .",neutral
What do you know ? You are over weight too .,neutral
I'm not on a diet though .,neutral
"I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .",neutral
I like ice cream too much though .,neutral
C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .,neutral
It does sound appealing .,neutral
It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .,positive
Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .,positive
Great . I'll get our plan started right away .,positive
Can we start tomorrow though ?,neutral
I need to buy some fruit .,neutral
All the fruit are pretty fresh here .,neutral
How much are the pears ?,neutral

"It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK .",neutral
How about Flymo ? It's selling well .,neutral
Do you have a warranty on it ?,neutral
Of course . The warranty period is one year .,neutral
"If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ?",neutral
"Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you .",neutral

"Very well , I'll take these two .",positive
May I take your order now ?,neutral
"Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please .",neutral
How would you like your eggs ?,neutral
"Hard-boiled , please .",neutral
"And your toast , light or dark ?",neutral
"Dark , please .",neutral
Now or later ?,neutral
Later will do .,neutral
Will there be anything else ?,neutral
"No , that's all . Thanks .",positive
One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow .,neutral
That's right .,neutral
"Just a moment , please .",neutral
May I have a reservation ?,neutral
"Yes , of course .",neutral
I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window .,neutral
"All right . Your name , please .",neutral

Goodbye .,positive
What are you doing ?,neutral
I'm watching TV .,neutral
Are there any good programs on TV ?,neutral
Tingling is on TV .,neutral
Which Channel is it ?,neutral
Channel 8 .,neutral
It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ?,neutral
I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls .,neutral
"Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor .",positive
"Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor .",neutral
Are you sure ?,neutral
"Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful .",neutral
Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ?,neutral
Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up .,neutral
"Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ?",positive
Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right .,neutral
"And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in .",neutral
"Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend .",positive
"Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ?",neutral
Yes . May I help you ?,neutral
Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ?,neutral
"Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ?",neutral
Let me see . It seems a little late .,neutral

We also have a cat and a dog .,neutral
Do you take your dog for a walk every day ?,neutral
"No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday .",neutral
"And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday .",neutral
Who takes the dog on Saturday ?,neutral
On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us .,neutral
Do you help with the housework ?,neutral
My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room .,neutral
"You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast .",neutral
I agree . And it's very convenient .,neutral
Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail .,neutral
Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time .,positive
"Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house !",positive
"Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?",positive
I am cooking now !,neutral
Are you good at cooking ?,neutral
"I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !",neutral
It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !,neutral
I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?,neutral
"Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .",neutral
That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .,neutral
I have the same idea as yours .,neutral
It's OK . Please have a taste of it .,neutral
"Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .",positive
Thank you for your praise .,positive
"Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?",neutral
"I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .",neutral
"So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?",neutral
Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .,neutral
Thanks a lot .,positive
It's my pleasure .,positive
"Alright , tell me what you think about this one .",neutral
Don't you think it's a bit bright ?,neutral
"Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?",neutral
"That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?",neutral
"No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .",positive
"I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .",neutral
"How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",neutral
That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?,neutral
That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .,positive
"Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",positive
Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?,neutral
That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?,positive
"The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it .",positive
Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .,neutral
"I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .",negative
"That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?",neutral
"No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon .",neutral
"Boy , come here !",neutral
"Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ?",neutral
"Bring me a cup of coffee , please .",neutral
Will you have it strong or weak ?,neutral
I prefer strong .,neutral
Won't you have some of this ?,neutral
"Yes , thanks .",positive
It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .,neutral
It's very good . How do you make it ?,positive
I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .,neutral
This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .,positive
I'm glad you like it .,positive
You Americans usually have nutritious food .,neutral
"Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?",positive
We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .,neutral
I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .,neutral
"Here , Let me get the door for you .",neutral
Thanks .,positive
Do you need a hand with that ?,neutral
"Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much .",positive
Don't worry about it .,neutral
"Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school .",negative
Is he doing very well at school ?,neutral
"He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies .",neutral
What's his problem ?,neutral
This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem .,neutral
How can his he do that ?,neutral
"There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem .",neutral
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .,neutral
"What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .",neutral
But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .,neutral
"Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .",neutral
There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?,neutral
"I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper .",neutral
What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?,neutral
I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market .,neutral
I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years .,neutral
"Good morning , Mrs . Smith .",neutral
"Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .",neutral

Promise that you won't get angry .,negative
"OK , I promise . What is it ?",neutral
It's a kitty .,neutral
"Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .",negative
"Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .",neutral
No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .,negative
"Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .",neutral
All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .,neutral
"I will . Thank you , Mummy .",positive
There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide .,neutral
You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds .,neutral
"But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .",neutral
"To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue .",neutral

What kind of apartment is it ?,neutral

You are sort of romantic .,neutral

I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed .,neutral
The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ?,neutral
Yes . But not including the utilities .,neutral

"Yes , I've got it .",neutral
"OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .",neutral
Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ?,neutral
Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .,neutral
"Now , I've got it . Thank you .",positive
"Hello , who's that speaking ?",neutral

"Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too .",neutral
Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ?,positive
"Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you .",positive
"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .",neutral
OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .,neutral
"I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?",neutral
"Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .",neutral
"Oh , great idea !",positive
"Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro .",neutral
"Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ?",positive
"It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month .",neutral
That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well .,positive
That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there .,neutral
I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised .,neutral

No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .,neutral
"I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .",positive
"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there .",neutral
Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ?,positive
Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .,neutral
Ok . Thank you .,positive

What's the matter with it ?,neutral
I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here .,neutral
How about the tires ?,neutral
Nothing serious . The right one needs some air .,neutral
"Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ?",neutral
"Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner .",neutral
Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ?,neutral
It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights .,neutral
OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ?,neutral
"You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right .",neutral
And do I take that road ?,neutral
"Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left .",neutral
Is there a Post Office sign on the building ?,neutral
Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it .,neutral
Thank you very much .,positive
You're welcome .,positive
"Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ?",neutral
"No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man .",neutral
I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald .,neutral
That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald .,neutral
May I take your order now ?,neutral
"Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ?",neutral
Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .,neutral
The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?,neutral
"Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .",neutral
"Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar .",neutral
"Then , how about this one ?",neutral
OK . I'll have that .,neutral
Very good . Could I serve you anything else ?,positive
Thank you . That's enough .,positive
"My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch .",positive
Thanks .,positive
Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 .,neutral
I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 .,neutral
So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you .,neutral
Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ?,neutral
"Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us .",neutral
So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 .,neutral
And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 .,neutral
And is that all ?,neutral
"Yes , this is everything on the list .",neutral
So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ?,neutral
"Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ?",neutral
I think £ 5 would be good .,neutral
Good evening .,neutral
Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim .,neutral
"Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim .",neutral
But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon .,neutral
"It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?",neutral
"Well , it's a window table that we've booked .",neutral
"I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .",negative
"Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one .",neutral
"Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim .",positive
"If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here .",neutral
"Yes , I will .",neutral
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .,neutral
We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .,negative
"I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .",neutral
We need to find a good realtor .,neutral
"Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .",neutral
What do you mean ?,neutral
"Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .",neutral
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .,neutral
"Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .",neutral
"I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .",neutral
"Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .",neutral
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?,neutral
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .,neutral
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?,neutral
"Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .",neutral
Why ?,neutral
"That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .",neutral
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .,neutral
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .,neutral
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .,neutral
All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore .,neutral
"Where to , madam ?",neutral
"Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train .",neutral
I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam .,neutral
Here is the Grand Central Station .,neutral
Thank you . How much is the fare ?,neutral
The meter reads 9.15 dollars .,neutral
Here you are . Keep the change .,neutral
Thank you .,neutral
"Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant .",neutral
Thank you .,positive
Do you have a reservation ?,neutral
"Yes , I do .",neutral
"May I have your name , please ?",neutral
"Yes , it's Mr . Brown .",neutral
"Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ?",neutral
"Oh , this is just fine .",positive
Please take a seat .,neutral
Thank you .,positive
Here is the menu .,neutral
Would you like to have a piece of cake ?,neutral
"No , thank you . I'm on a diet .",neutral
Why ? You're not fat .,neutral
"I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure .",neutral
Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident .,neutral
I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only .,neutral
Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties .,neutral
How much do they weigh ?,neutral
All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg .,neutral
But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest .,neutral
Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ?,neutral
Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it .,neutral
How long will it take me to get there ?,neutral
It's only about a five-minute walk .,neutral
Thank you very much .,positive
You're welcome .,positive
"Where to , sir .",neutral
"To this place , please .",neutral
Star Hotel . OK .,neutral
How long does it take to get to the hotel ?,neutral
About 20 minutes .,neutral
Here's the hotel .,neutral
How much is the fare ?,neutral
That's 10 dollars .,neutral
"Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton .",neutral
Do you know in which area ?,neutral
"No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here .",neutral
"I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ?",neutral
"Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station .",neutral
Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station .,neutral
Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ?,neutral
OK .,neutral
"Hello , are you interested in this Honda ?",neutral
"Hi , I am just looking .",neutral
It's a good car .,neutral
What year is it ?,neutral
1999 .,neutral
How about the mileage ?,neutral
"6,000 miles , all highway mileage .",neutral
What do you mean 7B,neutral
Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much .,neutral
"Oh , why such a high mileage ?",neutral
The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line .,neutral
Okay . Does this car have a warranty ?,neutral
One month .,neutral
How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ?,neutral
You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage .,neutral
How much is it ?,neutral
"$ 5,900 .",neutral
I'll have to think about it .,neutral
"Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ?,neutral
We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings .,neutral
I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap .,neutral
You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?,neutral
"Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so .",neutral
"While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove .",neutral
We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green .,neutral
I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners .,neutral
"Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook .",negative
"No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room .",neutral
"Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year .",neutral
And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ?,neutral
Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ?,neutral
Four times might be enough . Not once or twice .,neutral
"Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month .",neutral
"Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ?",positive
"Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ?",neutral
Not really .,neutral
What did you do for your last move ?,neutral
"Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out .",neutral
Oh . that's very nice of him .,positive
"Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you .",neutral
"Yes , please .",neutral
"Miss , may I help you ?",neutral
"Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different .",neutral
It's because of the view .,neutral
Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ?,neutral
Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .,positive
How many elevators are there ?,neutral
There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units .,neutral
How about the car-park space ?,neutral
"There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents .",neutral
Any other facilities ?,neutral
"Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .",neutral
What is the completion date ?,neutral
The completion date will be July 1st 2007 .,neutral
How about the price and the bank mortgage ?,neutral
"Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers .",neutral
How many payment methods are there ?,neutral
It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .,neutral
Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help .,positive
You're welcome .,positive
"You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal .",neutral
"I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .",neutral
"Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves .",neutral
That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another .,neutral
"Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ?",neutral
I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there .,neutral
How often dose this bus go there ?,neutral
Every fifteen minutes .,neutral
I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ?,neutral
The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it .,neutral
Where can I find the bus ?,neutral
The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it .,neutral
Thanks a lot .,positive
You are welcome .,positive
"Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? !",neutral
I'd like a coffee please .,neutral
"Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ?",neutral
What have you got ?,neutral
"Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano .",neutral
Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please .,positive
Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there .,neutral
"Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate .",neutral
"Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal .",neutral
"Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ?",neutral
"I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean .",neutral
"I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment .",neutral
What is your favorite coffee ?,neutral
Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it .,neutral
All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?,neutral
"Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .",neutral
"I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .",neutral
Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world .,neutral
"I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?",neutral
"Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .",neutral
"No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .",neutral
I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now .,neutral
"Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ?",neutral
"Yes , you're at the right stop .",neutral
Thank you .,positive
Are you new here ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
Have you got small change ? They require exact fare .,neutral
"Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ?",neutral
"One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box .",neutral
I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ?,neutral
"It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus .",neutral
May I know where you are going ?,neutral
Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .,neutral
I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .,neutral
Oh no ! What shall I do ?,neutral
Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .,neutral
Thank you very much .,positive
My pleasure .,positive
Here we are on the train .,neutral
"Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon .",neutral
I hear many people have cars .,neutral
"Yes , almost all the families have their own cars .",neutral
Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?,neutral
"Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown .",neutral
I see .,neutral
"Good coming , sir .",neutral
Good morning .,neutral
Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ?,neutral
Of course not . But I don't know when to get off .,neutral

That's very easy . The exit is always open .,neutral
Thank you for your help .,positive
My pleasure .,positive
May I try on this pair of shoes ?,neutral
Of course . What is your size ?,neutral
I think it's 35 .,neutral
OK . I'll get it for you .,neutral
"Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable .",negative
"Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ?",neutral
This is just right for me . I'll take this one .,positive
Can I see some men's watches ?,neutral
Of course . How about this one ?,neutral
What functions does this watch have ?,neutral
It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function .,neutral
Is it waterproof ?,neutral
"Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee .",neutral
I'll take it . Please set the watch for me .,positive
Let's go to the cinema by bus .,neutral
Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient .,neutral
"OK , it will be a new experience for me .",neutral
"We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .",neutral
Where do we pay the fare ?,neutral
Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket .,neutral
Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?,neutral
"No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically .",neutral
"May I help you , sir ?",neutral
I'd like to buy a shirt .,neutral
What color do you want ?,neutral
I prefer the blue one .,neutral

It costs $ 200 .,neutral
It looks good . OK . I'll take it .,positive
Let's have a look at the map first .,neutral
All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .,neutral
Let's buy some tickets .,neutral
The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train,neutral
"Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?",neutral
"No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .",neutral
What would you have ?,neutral
I'll try Chinese wine .,neutral
"What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .",neutral
"OK . Give me one , please .",positive
Here it is .,positive
Thank you .,positive
I'm always at your service .,positive

What does it come with standard ?,neutral
"On all our new cars , the standards include",neutral
Cruise control ? I don't like that .,neutral
"Why not , sir ?",neutral
I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?,negative
"Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .",neutral
I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .,neutral
"You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .",neutral
I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?,neutral
"No , the sunroof is optional , sir .",neutral
I see .,neutral
"For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .",neutral
"Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .",neutral
"That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?",neutral
"We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .",neutral
My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .,neutral
"I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?",neutral
"Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?",neutral
"Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .",neutral
"Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .",neutral
"You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .",neutral
"Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .",neutral

No . Just talk to your manager and let me know .,neutral
"Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 .",negative
The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats .,neutral

Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?,neutral
"It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .",neutral

Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price .",neutral
Thirty percent ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?,neutral

"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?",neutral

I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .,neutral
"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .",negative
What ? Are you serious ?,positive
Yes .,neutral
But nobody uses Macintosh !,negative
"That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ?",neutral
"Yes , I'm from Taiwan .",neutral
"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .",neutral
But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .,neutral
There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .,neutral
Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .,negative
"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple .",neutral
"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .",positive
"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .",positive
Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright .,neutral
"Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you .",neutral

"Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ?",neutral
The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction .,neutral
"Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east .",positive

"Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ?",neutral

Have you got any outdoor interests ?,neutral
Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding .,neutral

"The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high .",neutral
I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings .,neutral

Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood .

"In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .",neutral
"You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .",neutral
Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .,neutral
"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . """,neutral
It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ',neutral
"Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .",positive

Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ?,neutral

"A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars .

"Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best .",neutral

"Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles .",neutral
"You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport .",positive
What do you think might be the source of its popularity ?,neutral
"I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ...",neutral
And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks .,neutral
"Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket .",neutral
"Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport",positive
"Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it .",neutral
I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong .,neutral
"Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign .",neutral
"I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ?",neutral
How do you feel ?,neutral
I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .,neutral
Here is the bigger size .,neutral
"This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ?",neutral
"Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ?",neutral
Give me a shot of whisky and soda .,neutral
"With or without ice , sir ?",neutral
Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste .,neutral
"Would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( Pouring soda )",neutral

She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog .,neutral

And bugs . They can catch anything .,neutral

Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi !,neutral
"Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .",positive
I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ?,neutral
"Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you .",neutral
"So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ?",neutral
"To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time .",neutral
Like this ?,neutral
"Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist .",positive
Did I do it right ?,neutral
No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing .,neutral
What should I do with my legs then ?,neutral
"Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another .",neutral
"Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ?",positive
Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape .,positive

How long will it take me to get there ?,neutral
It's only about 10 minutes ' walk .,neutral
Thank you very much .,positive
"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ?",neutral
"I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life .",neutral
"You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art .",neutral
"An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating .",positive
Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ?,neutral
I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels .,neutral
"All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life .",neutral
I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements .,neutral
"Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life .",neutral
"So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ?",neutral
"Indeed , you're exactly right !",positive
"Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ?",neutral
"Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do .",neutral
Are you sure ?,neutral
Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body .,neutral
Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ?,neutral
It could also help you increase vital capacity .,neutral
"That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight .",neutral
You will make it if you persist in it .,neutral
"Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ?",neutral

Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ?,positive
You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there .,neutral
What do you think about all the different diets people go on ?,neutral
I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !,neutral
But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?,neutral
"They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .",neutral
So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?,neutral
"Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .",neutral
How about drinking soda ?,neutral
"Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke .",neutral
That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ?,neutral
"My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .",neutral
How do you know so much about food and dieting ?,neutral
"You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now !",neutral
"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .",neutral
"I said , "" Do you want me to help you ? """,neutral
"If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help .",neutral
OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ?,neutral
"Hi , Mark .",neutral
"Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .",neutral
All right .,neutral
"So , what do we do now ?",neutral
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .,neutral
"Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .",neutral

Can I pay you by check ?,neutral

Is there a laundry room in the basement ?,neutral

Did you smell something ? It smells so great .,neutral
It must come from the bakery on the corner.They are baking cookies . Their cookies are very popular in town .,neutral
How come I never knew that ? Do they have a new baker or something ?,neutral
I think so . The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA . He is good at making cookies .,neutral
Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now .,neutral
"Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one .",neutral
You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter .,neutral
I am starting loving this bakery now .,neutral
It's one of my favorite bakeries .,neutral
You should have told me earlier . I am a cookie lover .,neutral

My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week .,neutral
I can't do that with my cat . She hates water .,neutral
"You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog .",neutral
Your dog is really cute . What's his name ?,neutral
His name is Bingo .,neutral
What kind of dog is he ?,neutral
We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away .,neutral
"Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ?",neutral
"Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now .",neutral
That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws .,neutral
I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ?,neutral
About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though .,neutral
Really ? Why is that ?,neutral

He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it .,positive
What's the latest fashion of evening gown ?,neutral
The one on the manikin is in fashion now .,neutral

"Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time . We should be able to down it before they close .",neutral
That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?,neutral
It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?,neutral
Yeah . I think I can find it .,neutral
You're back already . That sure was quick .,neutral
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .,neutral
"Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer.Anyway.He said it was too close to closing time .",neutral
"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .",neutral
"Okay , let's go !",positive
"Now , madam , here is the Hotel .",neutral
What's the fare ?,neutral
$ 15 .,neutral
The fare is different from the meter .,neutral

Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days .,neutral
"Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars !",positive
OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you .,neutral
Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ?,neutral
"I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special .",positive
"Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice .",neutral
"Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ?",positive
"I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits .",neutral
"Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ?",neutral

Where's my book ?,neutral
Which one ?,neutral
The dictionary .,neutral
It's under the table .,neutral
Where's my pencil ?,neutral
There's a pencil in front of the lamp .,neutral
That's not a pencil . That's a pen .,neutral
"Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup .",neutral
How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ?,neutral
It's in between the wall and the bed .,neutral
Where are my shoes ?,neutral
They're on the left side of the TV .,neutral
I don't see them .,neutral
"Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV .",negative
Thanks .,positive
"Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone .",neutral

I don't like to keep up with joneses .,neutral

I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ?,neutral
"Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !",negative
"I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .",positive
"Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him .",neutral
I'll put the song at the front of the list .,neutral
Who wants to go first ? Lily ?,neutral
Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ?,neutral
OK.Put on something by the Backstreet Boys !,neutral
How about As Long as You Love Me ? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke !,neutral
I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys !,neutral
I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game !,positive
"Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me !",neutral
"At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go .",neutral
"I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?",neutral
"Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .",neutral
I know it is quite different from Western chess .,neutral
"Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .",neutral
But isn't it the same with wiki ?,neutral
"Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive .",neutral
May I take a look at the shoes over there ?,neutral
Certainly . What's your size ?,neutral
Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ?,neutral
They are all leather . How do they feel ?,neutral
It's comfortable . I will take it .,neutral
Try it on in front of the mirror .,neutral
"Well , I think the color is a little too bright .",neutral
We have darker ones . Do you like the style ?,neutral
Yes . What's this made of and how to wash it ?,neutral
lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water .,neutral
Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic !,negative
"If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy !",negative
He sounds like a sick cow !,negative
Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key .,neutral
I already tried that . Nothing seems to help .,neutral
Hey ! Where are you going ... ?,neutral
Coing out for a walk .,neutral
Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers .,neutral
"OK . I am hungry , too . I like their milkshake . They're very creamy and tasty .",neutral
"Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious .",neutral
"Yup . But , this also means we have to wait to order our food .",neutral
"Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it .",neutral
"Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious .",neutral
"Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it .",neutral
"OK , I think I know what to order for my lunch now . But , eating too much fried food really makes me fat .",neutral
"Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you .",neutral
That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry !,negative
Be patient . Good food never comes fast .,neutral
Ok !,neutral
"Hi , is you , John ?",neutral
"Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times .",neutral
"Sorry , John . I suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day .",neutral
"But I called your cell phone , and there was no answer .",neutral
"I know , I left it at home .",neutral
Do you feel better now ?,neutral
"It's OK now . Don't worry , John .",neutral
I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ?,neutral
"For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese .",neutral
"I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders .",neutral
"Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance .",neutral
"Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable .",neutral
"Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China .",neutral
"There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess .",neutral
"You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ?",neutral
"Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances .",neutral
"Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes .",neutral
"Sorry , turkey . I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight , remember ? And I'm watching ' Disco Fever ' on channel 6 .",neutral
"Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ...",neutral
"Hey , what's wrong with the TV ?",neutral
I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube .,neutral
Looks like the TV wins that argument .,neutral
"Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ?",neutral
"Sure , why not ?",neutral
Do you have cheongsams ?,neutral
Yes.We have in stock a variety of styles and they are in different colors.What do you think of this one ?,neutral
The styte is OK . Which country is this made in ?,neutral
It's made in China . The quality is excellent .,positive
Please wrap it .,neutral
Can I help you in any way ?,neutral

How do you like this pattern ? The pink suits you well .,neutral
Will it wash well and the color won't fade ?,neutral
It's of good quality .,neutral
Do you want to buy a sweater ?,neutral
Yes . Which one is the latest ?,neutral
The cowl-neck pullovers are new in . It sells like hot cakes .,neutral
It's my style . Will it be resistance to balling ?,neutral
Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality .,neutral
May I help you ?,neutral
"Yes , I am looking for a coat .",neutral
Do you have any style in your mind ?,neutral
I have no idea .,neutral
I recommend you this one . It's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing .,neutral
"Well , it's good in style , but I am afraid it doesn't wash well .",neutral
I think this suit displays your nice finger .,neutral
Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ?,positive
No problem .,positive
Will it shrink when washed ?,neutral
"Of course not , it is made of pure silk .",neutral
Are you ready to go shopping ?,neutral
Just a few minutes . I need to make a list of the things that we need .,neutral
"Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ?",positive
"I forgot about the potatoes . Oh , I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . What kind of tea do you prefer ? Green tea or flower tea ?",neutral
Let's just get both . Do you bring enough money ?,neutral
"We don ’ t have enough cash , but I ’ ll take my credit card .",neutral
"Could I speak to Mr . Wu , please ?",neutral
"Who ’ s calling , please ?",neutral
This is Kevin .,neutral
"Hold on a second , please .",neutral
"This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture .",neutral
I had planned to . I can bring some from my place . And there's some more at my parents ' .,neutral
Do you have a bed ?,neutral
"Of course , I have . There is one in my old house . And I have another one from college at my parents ' house .",neutral
That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room .,positive
"Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to .",positive
"Yeah . By the way , can I take a shower ?",neutral
"Sure , but I don't have hot water , yet .",neutral
Really ?,neutral
"No , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . My phone should be working then , too .",neutral
"Well , do you want to go outside for dinner ?",neutral
"Yeah , I can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . Let's go to the restaurant nearby . It's my treat .",neutral
OK . Let's go .,neutral
Hello . I am Bili and I made an appointment with you to see the house .,neutral
"Glad to meet you . This way , please .",positive
The house is a little too old .,neutral
But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby .,neutral
Yes . That's why I like the house .,positive
Hello . Manchester 6739792 .,neutral
Hello . Is that Nicholas ?,neutral

Never ! Do you know his new number ?,neutral
"Yes . I've got it somewhere . Let me see . Where did I put it ? Ah - I remember , it's on the memo . Here it is . Do you have a pen to write it down ?",neutral
"Yes , I do . Go on .",neutral
His number's 4945939 .,neutral
4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help .,positive
Slow down ! You can't exceed the speed limits .,neutral
"No , I cann't . I'm in a hurry !",neutral
"No , you can not . It is dangerous .",neutral
"Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road .",negative
No . You shouldn't drive like that .,neutral
Good afternoon .,neutral
My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .,neutral

When do you have lunch ?,neutral
From one to two .,neutral
What do you normally eat ?,neutral
We usually go to the cafeteria .,neutral
"Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now .",neutral
let ’ s go together .,neutral
( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?,neutral
Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .,neutral
"As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?",neutral
"To begin with , I have to use chopsticks .",neutral
But you look quite proficient in using them now .,neutral
"Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table .",neutral
"Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow !",neutral
Anything strange about that ?,neutral
"Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .",neutral
"Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .",neutral
Excuse me . Have you got the time ?,neutral
My watch says half past five .,neutral
Does your watch keep good time ?,neutral
Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .,neutral
Thanks a lot .,positive
I like to drive on freeway .,neutral
Don't drive too fast .,neutral
Don't worry.There ' re few cars now .,neutral
Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast .,neutral
There's going to be a highway here .,neutral
That's better .,neutral
The traffic problem will soon be eased .,neutral
I think so .,neutral
"How do you spend your day , Helen ?",neutral
"Well , on weekdays I get up around ten . Then I read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon .",neutral
Really ? What time do you go to work ?,neutral
I start work at three .,neutral
And when do you get home at night ?,neutral
"I get home pretty late , around midnight .",neutral
"So what do you do , exactly ?",neutral

Help will be there in just a few minutes .,neutral
"Mum , pass me some more please !",neutral
"Tina , you should have more nutritious food . Don't eat these crisps any more .",neutral
But the ads say they're most nutritious .,neutral
Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ?,neutral
"Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman .",neutral
How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ?,neutral
"No , I'm not asking for money , I'm asking for your advice .",neutral
"Oh , you've already grown up , son .",positive
Will you look at this form ?,neutral
Are you having problems with it ?,neutral
I don't understand some things .,neutral
Let me help you .,neutral
What does MI mean ?,neutral
MI stands for Middle Initial .,neutral
What does MM / DD / YY mean ?,neutral
That means Month / Day / Year . Use numbers .,neutral
I don't understand .,neutral
"For example , if your birth date is January 12 , 1987 , write 01/12 /8 7 .",neutral
Oh . That's simple enough .,neutral
"Always print clearly , and fill in the bubbles completely .",neutral
Let's go to the animal shelter .,neutral

Do you know which one he would like ?,neutral

I wonder what he'll name it .,neutral

"How much is the fare , please ?",neutral
One dollar . Drop it in the box . Move to the rear of the bus . There are plenty of seats in the rear .,neutral
Wait . I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village .,neutral
"That's right.Move along , please.There are more people waiting to get on.Move to the rear .",neutral
I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue .,neutral
"No , that's the number l that goes down Park Avenue.This is the number 2 .",neutral
But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park .,neutral
It is.Get in.please.You ' re holding everyone up.You can't miss Washington Square Park .,neutral

It would be better if you watched out for yourself . I might forget .,neutral

You need a bath every day .,neutral

Because you don't want to smell bad .,neutral
I don't smell bad .,neutral
That's what you think .,neutral
"If I smelled bad , I could smell me .",neutral
I can smell you .,neutral
"I can smell you , too .",neutral
That's my perfume .,neutral
When can I wear perfume ?,neutral
Yikes ! What was that noise ?,positive
I had to blow my nose .,neutral
Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?,neutral
Did you hear that ?,neutral
Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .,neutral
It wasn't that loud .,neutral
"I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .",neutral
Okay . I'll take your word for it .,neutral
I thought you had an elephant in your house .,positive
You're funny .,neutral
What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .,neutral
I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .,neutral

"No problem . First of all , do you want to get a home computer or a laptop ?",neutral
"Laptops are more expensive , right ?",neutral
"Yes , they generally cost a little more .",neutral
I'll just get a regular home computer then . I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me .,neutral
I called HP about my computer .,neutral
What did they say ?,neutral
They said I need a new hard drive .,neutral
That's too bad . How much is a new one ?,neutral
"It's not too much , only about $ 85 .",neutral
Plus installation ?,neutral
"No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .",neutral
Really ?,neutral
"Yes , it's just a couple of screws .",neutral
That's nice .,positive
It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .,neutral
"If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .",neutral
I'm going to take a nap .,neutral
You should unplug the phone .,neutral
That's a good idea .,neutral
Do you want me to wake you in an hour ?,neutral
"No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up .",neutral
I'll start dinner at 6:00 .,neutral
Okay . I think I'll be awake by then .,neutral
"If not , your nose will wake you up .",neutral
You mean I will smell the food cooking ?,neutral
You might even dream about dinner .,neutral
I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired .,neutral
Have a nice nap .,neutral
Something's wrong with my computer .,neutral
Exactly what ?,neutral
All I get is a black screen .,neutral

You're smart .,neutral
Do you want an IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh ?,neutral
I'm not sure . What's the difference ?,neutral
"Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ?",neutral
Mostly just to browse the Internet and send emails to friends .,neutral
"Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more .",neutral
Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ?,neutral
I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ?,neutral
Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet .,neutral
"This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ?",neutral
This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular .,neutral
"Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one .",neutral
I think I'll get some new goggles .,neutral
"Good idea . I'll get some , too .",positive
We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ?,neutral
Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays .,neutral

So are you going to get a new swimsuit ?,neutral
"Yeah , I think I'll get this one-piece .",neutral
Why don't you get a bikini ?,neutral
I'm too fat for a bikini .,neutral
You aren't fat . I'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . How about this thong bikini ?,neutral
I'll wear that if you'll wear these Speedos .,neutral
"I guess that one-piece isn't too bad , either . ( to be continued )",neutral
"This is a good basic computer package . It's got a good CPU , 256 megabytes of RAM , and a DVD player .",neutral
Does it come with a modem ?,neutral
"Yes , it has a built-in modem . You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer .",neutral
How about the monitor ?,neutral
"A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . If you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money .",neutral
"That's okay . A 15 - inch is good enough . All right , I'll take it .",positive
Are you ready ?,neutral
Ready for what ?,neutral
Ready for the big switch .,neutral
What are you talking about ?,neutral
The nation is switching to digital TV .,neutral
Oh . Of course I'm ready .,neutral

"Say , I like racquetball , too .",neutral
"Oh , do you want to play sometime ?",neutral
Uh ... how well do you play ?,neutral
"Pretty well , I guess .",neutral
"Well , all right . But I'm not very good .",neutral
"No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard .",neutral
Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it .,neutral
"No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged .",neutral
But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride .,neutral
I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time .,neutral
"This is No . 1 bus , bound for Sihun .",neutral
"Excuse me . I will go to Wangfujing , where should I get off ?",neutral
There are another six stops .,neutral
We are arriving at Tiananmen . Please get ready for your arrival .,neutral
Is it Wangfujing ?,neutral
"No , sir . The next stop is Wangfujing .",neutral
OK .,neutral
Please get ready .,neutral
Thank you .,positive
We are arriving at Wangfujing . Please get ready .,neutral
Is this where I get off ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
May I take your order ?,neutral
"Yes . I'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please .",neutral
All right . And would you like a salad ?,neutral
Yes . I'll have a mixed green salad .,neutral
"OK . What kind of dressing would you like ? We have vinaigrette , Italian , and French .",neutral
"Italian , please .",neutral
And would you like anything to drink ?,neutral
"Yes , I'd like a large soda , please .",neutral
Could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ?,neutral
"He's a bright boy , isn't he ?",neutral
But he always wimps out of difficulty .,neutral
"Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .",neutral
Did you put the blue bin out on the street ?,neutral
"Oh , no . I forgot .",neutral
"Well , you'd better take it out front .",neutral
What time does the recycle truck come by ?,neutral
"It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow .",neutral
I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning .,neutral
"Oh , no , you don't .",neutral
What do you mean ?,neutral
Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late .,neutral
Do you think I'll forget to do it ?,neutral
"You'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it .",neutral
"Okay , I'll take it out front right now .",neutral
"Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in .",neutral
Oh . Yes ?,neutral
I'm looking for a grocery store . Are there any around here ?,neutral
"Yes , there are some on Pine Street .",neutral
OK . And is there a laundromat near here ?,neutral
"Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center .",neutral
Thank you .,positive
"By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too .",neutral
A barber shop ? !,positive
Is this the right bus for San Francisco ?,neutral
"It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine .",neutral
When's the first stop ?,neutral
"About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me .",neutral
Thank you .,positive
Is it all right to smoke on the bus ?,neutral
"Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed .",neutral
I see . Thank you .,positive
Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ?,neutral
I only wish it were this time yesterday .,neutral
Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong .,neutral
Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better .,neutral
I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us .,neutral
Perhaps I'd better ring the police ...,neutral
Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car .,neutral
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !,positive
Thank you ! Guess how much it costs .,positive
"Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess .",neutral
Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five .,neutral
"Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?",neutral
Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down .,neutral
How much did she ask for ?,neutral
"Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty .",neutral
"She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ?",neutral
"Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head .",neutral
Then you pretended to go without buying it ?,neutral
"Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . '",neutral
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .,negative
"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?",neutral
"yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .",negative
"is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .",neutral
but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?,negative
"of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .",neutral
"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .",neutral
Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .,neutral
"Yes , Mum .",neutral
Is your father in the habit of having naps ?,neutral
"Yes , all of us have naps .",neutral
Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ?,neutral
"No , not at all .",neutral
When do you go to bed usually ?,neutral
I go to bed at ten and get up at six .,neutral
That's helpful for your health .,neutral
Sure .,neutral
"Are you ready , Pa ?",neutral
In a second . Have you got a torch ?,neutral
No .,neutral
Here it is . Let's go .,neutral
Let's see if we forget anything .,neutral
"Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area .",neutral
"Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please .",neutral
All right .,neutral
Do you like the cookies ?,neutral
I finished them in no time .,neutral
Glad you like it .,positive
"Mum , when will we have them again ?",neutral
"I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?",neutral
"OK , Mum , when will you be back ?",neutral
I'll be back in ten days .,neutral
Why is the car before us stopping ?,neutral
What's going on ?,neutral
Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .,neutral
More and more people easily get irritated while driving .,neutral
Yes . This is what is called road rage .,neutral
"Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?",neutral
Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday .,neutral
Anything wrong with it ?,neutral
"Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .",neutral
"Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?",neutral
Here it is .,neutral
"Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .",neutral
That's very kind of you . Thank you .,positive
"We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .",neutral
Would you like a cigarette ?,neutral
"No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .",neutral
Really ? Why ?,neutral
"Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .",neutral
I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?,neutral
"That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health .",neutral
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .,negative
"But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !",neutral
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?,neutral
I mean you couldn't give it up !,neutral
What's your weight .,neutral
150 pounds .,neutral
"Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat .",neutral
I can't bear eating less .,neutral
your muscles are a spectacle !,positive
Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise .,positive
"By the way , do you work out ?",neutral
"No , but I am starting working out from now on .",neutral
Fine .,neutral
Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?,neutral
No.Why ?,neutral
Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .,neutral
"Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day .",neutral
I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks .,neutral
"Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it .",neutral
You've formed a sound habit .,neutral
"I think so , too .",neutral
"Excuse me , ma'am ?",neutral
Yes . What can I do for you ?,neutral
I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room .,neutral
"Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me .",neutral
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?,neutral
I attend an aerobic class three times a week .,neutral
Aren't you tired ?,neutral
"No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .",positive
"Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ?",positive
It was okay .,neutral
Would you like a drink ?,neutral
"No thanks , I'm not thirsty .",neutral
Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ?,neutral
Not really .,neutral
Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ?,neutral
Yes I did .,neutral
Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ?,positive
Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual .,neutral
I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ?,neutral
We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ?,neutral
"No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too .",neutral
"Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer .",neutral
Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue .,neutral
I'll see you later then .,neutral
Bye ! I'll be back before seven .,positive
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .,neutral
Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .,neutral
"No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .",neutral
"You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?",neutral
"Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .",neutral
Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?,neutral
"Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .",neutral
Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?,neutral
"Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .",positive
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday .,neutral
Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ?,neutral
"Yes , that would be good !",positive
We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ?,neutral
"If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading .",neutral
"You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ?",neutral
"Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are .",neutral
"Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert .",neutral
Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now .,neutral
Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift .,positive
"In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people .",neutral
"Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off !",neutral
"Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places .",neutral
"Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people .",neutral
"Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas .",neutral
"What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar .",neutral
"Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink .",neutral
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?,neutral
I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table .,neutral
"You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .",neutral
"I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .",neutral
"You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .",neutral
"A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .",neutral
"Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .",neutral
I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .,neutral
"Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it .",neutral
"You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea .",neutral
"So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it .",neutral
"It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning "" Thanks "" . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup .",neutral
"So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ?",neutral
"Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal .",neutral
"What does that imply , then ?",neutral
"More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' .",neutral
I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday .,neutral
We have some fresh red roses .,neutral
How much are the roses ?,neutral
Twenty dollars per dozen .,neutral
That sounds like a good deal .,positive
"Yes , that is today's sale price .",neutral
I'll take a dozen .,neutral
Is there anything else you'd like to get ?,neutral
"No , the roses will be fine .",neutral
I'm sure your wife will love them .,positive
"Overseas operator , may I help you ?",neutral
Yes . I would like to place a collect call .,neutral
Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?,neutral
Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .,neutral
Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .,neutral
What reasons do westerners drink for ?,neutral
"I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine .",neutral
"I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship .",neutral
"And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink "" one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste .",neutral
"Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable .",neutral
"Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet !",neutral
Why are there so many people ?,neutral
It seems like a traffic accident .,neutral
Those people are quarrelling .,neutral
It's raining heavily .,neutral
We have to find a shelter .,neutral
All right .,neutral
Let's go under the tree .,neutral
"No , we can't . It's thundering .",neutral
Then let's go to that store .,neutral
"Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?",neutral
"It's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria .",neutral
"Cindy , you're so cute .",neutral
"She is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ?",neutral
I have a little white cat .,neutral
"Oh , a cat ? Come on .",positive
"Yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small .",neutral
"But I think they're dull , aren't they ?",neutral
Not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs .,neutral
"Well , cats are certainly more independent .",neutral
"Absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago .",neutral
"oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?",positive
Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it .,neutral
Poor cat .,neutral
Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special .,positive
Traffic rules are different among countries .,neutral
For example ?,neutral
People drive on the right in China .,neutral
"Oh , that's interesting !",positive
How can we avoid the jam ?,neutral
Let's take a roundabout way .,neutral
OK .,neutral
"Look , traffic jam again !",negative
Usually cities have greater traffic problems .,neutral
"Of course , there're too many people .",neutral
I hate the car columns on the road .,neutral
But we couldn't help it .,neutral
How do you get road news ?,neutral
I've a driver mate in my car !,neutral
So you have all the news on broadcast ?,neutral
"Yes , it's so helpful .",positive
I can't find proper parking space .,neutral
Let's just park here .,neutral
"No , there's no parking sign .",neutral
"Oh , the policeman's coming .",neutral
"Look , there is traffic accident over there .",neutral
What happened ?,neutral
The old man is knocked down by the bicycle .,neutral
"John , it ’ s time to get up .",neutral
It can ’ t be time to get up yet .,neutral
It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school .,negative
What ’ s the time ?,neutral
It ’ s nearly half past seven .,neutral
My watch says ten past .,neutral
It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .,negative
Are you sure half past seven ?,neutral
Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on .,neutral
( And here is the seven o ’ clock news ) It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast .,neutral
"No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night .",neutral
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .,neutral
This is the rush hour .,neutral
I notice there's a jam a few blocks away .,neutral
Let's drive off this road .,neutral
I'm afraid I'll be late .,neutral
How often does the bus run ?,neutral
Every five minutes .,neutral
"Oh , here comes a bus !",neutral
It comes on the dot .,neutral
Why do you stop me ?,neutral
You have gone against the traffic rules .,neutral
I'm sorry .,negative
Do you know this is a Onaway street ?,neutral
I don't know .,neutral
You have to pay a fine .,neutral
There're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day !,neutral
I think something must be done .,neutral
"Yeah , we should have more roads built .",neutral
"Shit , so crowded !",negative
The radio said it's OK on this road .,neutral
Things change every minute .,neutral
We have too many cars !,negative
How long do I have to wait ?,neutral
Two hours.That area is a little backward .,neutral
I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities .,neutral
You're right .,neutral
"Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?",neutral
You really should go to Rachel's pet store .,neutral
Why ? anything special there ?,neutral
It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .,neutral
"Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?",neutral
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .,positive
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .,positive
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?,neutral
Why not ? it's so cool .,neutral
But it will pose a risk to your health .,neutral
Pardon ?,positive
"I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .",neutral
"Well , I didn't realize that .",neutral
"I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .",neutral
"Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .",neutral
"Yes , good luck , Maria .",neutral
Excuse me . Would you tell me where The People's Park is ?,neutral
"The People's Park is located on Nanjing Road , near Limbo road , just on the opposite side of the International Hotel .",neutral
How long will it take me to get there ?,neutral
Only about twenty minutes .,neutral
"I'm not going in the wrong direction , am I ?",neutral
"No , you aren't . Just go ahead , please .",neutral
May I take a bus to get there ?,neutral
You can take the No . 22 trolley bus to get there .,neutral
OK . Thank you a lot .,positive
What a terrible house !,negative
"I'm sick of it , too .",neutral
"The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking",negative
"There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart !",negative
"It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !",negative
Do you like shopping ?,neutral
Yeah . I go shopping once a week,neutral
Why don't you do your shopping at home ?,neutral
What do you mean ? I can't understand .,neutral
"I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce .",neutral
Really ? That's unbelievable .,neutral
"Oh , here comes a bus !",neutral
It's here at last !,neutral
How long have you waited ?,neutral
Twenty minutes exactly .,neutral
I'll be late because I have waited so long !,negative
Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon .,neutral
I'd better take a taxi .,neutral
That's no use.This is morning rush hour .,neutral
"Oh , the bus is gone .",neutral
Pity we didn't catch it .,neutral
I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus .,negative
We have to wait six more minutes !,negative
Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ?,neutral
"Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted .",positive
Have you ever seen such a nice house ?,neutral
Not really .,neutral
This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new .,neutral
It's great !,positive
"I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen .",neutral
"high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room .",neutral
"It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood .",positive
What about the one on the Yellow River Road ?,neutral
"It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen .",neutral
It's a bit small but looks nice .,neutral
"What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company .",neutral
"Hello , may I help you ?",neutral
Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent .,neutral
"Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .",neutral
A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for .,neutral
"Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK .",neutral
That sounds just wonderful to us .,positive
When do you want to move in ?,neutral
How about this afternoon ?,neutral
Fine . I'll be expecting you around two .,positive
"My dear , it's five flights up !",positive
"That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there .",neutral
We're little further away from the street and traffic noise,neutral
And there's no one living over us .,neutral
Is the place well-furnished ?,neutral
"Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .",neutral
What about the kitchen ?,neutral
"The stove and refrigerator are in good working order ,",neutral
And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires .,neutral
Are the plumbing all right ?,neutral
"The plumbing seems OK , too .",neutral
The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water,neutral
And the sinks don't seem to leak .,neutral
The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again .,neutral
"Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?",neutral
"Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store .",positive
That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?,neutral
"Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off .",neutral
"True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .",neutral
"Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places .",neutral
"Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not .",neutral
That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .,neutral
"I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions .",neutral
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door .,negative
"You're so careless , Billy .",neutral
"Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away .",negative
I've done it for you .,neutral
"My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?",neutral
An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?,neutral
"Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .",positive
"Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .",neutral
"That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .",neutral
"That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .",neutral
"Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .",neutral
That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?,neutral
256MB .,neutral
Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .,neutral
Can I help you ?,neutral
"Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ?",neutral
Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ?,neutral
"No , thanks .",neutral
"George , did you remember to buy me the book ?",neutral
"Sorry , darling , I forgot .",negative
When will you buy it then ?,neutral
I promise you'll have it tomorrow .,neutral
Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue .,neutral
It is true . I think we should change some policies .,neutral
Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts .,neutral
"Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing .",neutral
Like you and me !,neutral
"Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ?",neutral
"Sure , Mum.In a minute .",neutral
Here's the money.And get some salt .,neutral
"Yes , Mum .",neutral
I can't believe that .,neutral
What ?,neutral
I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today .,neutral
Oh . Why did she do that ?,positive
The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car .,neutral
"Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?",neutral
"No , I'm not clear .",neutral
"we've spent $ 1,000 .",neutral
Don't make a fuss.The price is rising,neutral
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?,neutral
I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades .,neutral
What do you think is the biggest change ?,neutral
"Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare .",neutral
"That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more .",neutral
Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ?,neutral
I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room .,neutral
"That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough !",neutral
How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?,neutral
"Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .",neutral
I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?,neutral
"They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .",neutral
"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?",neutral
"Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?",neutral
"First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs .",neutral
How can you get that done ?,neutral
"Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan .",neutral
What else ?,neutral
"Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .",neutral
Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?,positive
"That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .",neutral
Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first .,neutral
Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it .,neutral
"OK , I'll take it .",positive
"Hey , you look great ! how's everything ?",positive
"Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .",neutral
Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .,neutral
It's important to do proper exercises .,neutral
You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .,neutral
"The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .",neutral
Sounds reasonable .,neutral
We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .,neutral
And fruits !,neutral
Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .,neutral
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?,neutral
"Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .",neutral
"I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .",neutral
You bet it !,positive
"Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?",neutral
"Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .",neutral
Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .,neutral
"I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !",neutral
Really ? What's the series about ?,neutral
"Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .",neutral
"It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .",neutral
"I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .",neutral
Really ? that's interesting !,positive
"Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .",positive
"OK , I'll give it a go .",positive
Have you ever tried shopping online ?,neutral
"No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .",neutral
That's right . Seeing is believing .,neutral
"I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .",neutral
"That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .",neutral
"What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .",neutral
"It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .",neutral
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .,neutral
"Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .",neutral
That's a good idea .,positive
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !,positive
"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",positive
"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",neutral
"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",neutral
Me too .,neutral
"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",neutral
"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",neutral
"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .",positive
"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",neutral
And the host announced that he won it all !,positive
Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ?,neutral
"Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences .",neutral
"Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society .",neutral
That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes .,neutral
But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year .,neutral
"Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal .",neutral
No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite .,neutral
And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' .,neutral
The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' .,neutral
I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public .,neutral
Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?,neutral
I bought it online .,neutral
Really ? Do you often shop online ?,neutral
Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online .,neutral
I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?,neutral
"Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home .",neutral
"Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier .",positive
And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall .,neutral
"Well , are there any other advantages ?",neutral
"Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere .",neutral
Are there many choices of online shopping ?,neutral
Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .,neutral
Perhaps I should have a try .,neutral
Hello . Do you know how I can find a room to rent ?,neutral
There is so much information and I advise to read newspaper .,neutral
Will that work ?,neutral
"Yes , of course . If you like the room , call the landlord and confirm the information of the room .",neutral
Good idea . Thank you .,positive
Do you like the room ?,neutral
Yes . What is the rent ?,neutral
$ 300 per month .,neutral
Then what's the rent due date ?,neutral
"At the beginning of the month . Besides , you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit .",neutral
Do you have any apartment to rent ?,neutral
Yes . Right now I have a studio .,neutral
Where is it .,neutral
"In the downtown , near the square .",neutral
Is it furnished ?,neutral
"Yes , and the rent includes utilities .",neutral
That's good . When can I go to see the house ?,positive
What about next saturday .,neutral
Fine .,neutral
"Excuse me , where am I on this map ?",neutral
"You're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city .",neutral
Which bus should I take to railway station ?,neutral
You can take a No . 2 bus here .,neutral
Where am I supposed to change ?,neutral
At Longing Street .,neutral
"Julia , what time is it ?",neutral
Eight o'clock . It's time for you to get up and have breakfast .,neutral
"Oh , my God ! I'm going to be late ! I have no time to have breakfast now . ( Hurry on his clothes . )",positive
"You won't go to work today , Steven , It's Sunday . Come and have breakfast now .",neutral
"Oh , I have a poor memory now . I haven't had enough sleep lately . I had a bad dream just now .",neutral
"You have been too tired recently , darling . That's why I didn't wake you up this morning . After breakfast , you can go to sleep again .",neutral
Yes . I really need to have a good rest .,neutral
"Steven , it's ten o'clock . I'm going to bed . I'm beat .",neutral
Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We've sightly overspent this month .,neutral
"Oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? It's already past 10 .",neutral
"But I'm not sleepy , darling . I want to finish it today .",neutral
Okay . Please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . I don't want the dog down there tonight .,neutral
Okay . Good night . Have a good dream .,positive
Good night .,positive
You must be Mr.Sellers . I'm Steven . I am here to see the apartment you advertised .,neutral
"Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday .",positive
Could I have a look at it first ?,neutral
"Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old .",neutral
It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom .,neutral
Yes . And there's a walk-in closet .,neutral
Is there air conditioning ?,neutral
"Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。",neutral

"I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own .",neutral
"How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ?",neutral
That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?,neutral
That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .,positive
"Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",positive

"Ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?",neutral
"Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too .",neutral
That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?,positive
That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .,neutral
"Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .",neutral
"You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?",neutral
I don't think it's broken .,neutral
"Well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !",neutral

We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .,neutral
"That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .",neutral
It can't be that bad .,neutral
"I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .",neutral
"Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .",positive
"Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better .",neutral
"Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?",neutral

"Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know .",positive
"Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ?",neutral

Did someone get hurt ?,neutral
A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too .,neutral
What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ?,neutral
"I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk .",neutral
Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ?,neutral
I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool .,neutral

You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world .,neutral
"I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything .",neutral
What kind of errands do we need to run ?,neutral
"Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor .",neutral
I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight .,neutral
"Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time .",neutral
"Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers .",positive
I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for .,neutral

And ?,neutral
"I drink milk every day . It's really good for building strong bones and teeth . I drink tea quite often , for it's protective against kidney cancer .",neutral

I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that .,neutral
Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?,neutral
"I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished .",neutral
"You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?",neutral
"No , I thought that would be included in the rent .",neutral
"It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities .",neutral
I don't think I can afford that .,neutral
Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children .,neutral
That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .,positive
"Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing .",neutral
Why do you say that ?,neutral

What's your apartment like ?,neutral
It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .,neutral

I'd be up for that !,positive
"Steven , what's the expense of moving house ?",neutral
About 3 000 dollars .,neutral

We have to cut back on our shopping from now on .,neutral
Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income .,neutral
I hope so .,neutral
"Oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people .",neutral
"Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?",neutral
"Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?",neutral
"Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful !",positive

"All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !",positive

"Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .",positive
"Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .",positive
Why not try it on ?,neutral

"I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings .",neutral
"If you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise .",neutral
"Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now .",neutral
"Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .",positive

Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .,neutral

Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .,neutral

You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .,positive
"Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .",neutral
"I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .",neutral
"Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?",neutral

"That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?",neutral

"You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend .

I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable .",neutral
It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable !,neutral

Relly ? That's amazing .,positive
"Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly .",neutral
Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet .,positive
"Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try .",neutral
"Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat .",neutral
Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet .,neutral
"We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then !",positive

Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ?,neutral
An acoustic one .,neutral
Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ?,neutral
What ’ s the difference ?,neutral
"Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords .",neutral
I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar .,neutral
"In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation .",neutral
"This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one .",neutral

"Okay , come right this way .",neutral
"( They walk over to the apartment . ) As you can see , it's large and completely furnished .",neutral
What bills are included in the rent ?,neutral
"You have to pay the electricity bill yourself , but water is paid .",neutral
"Well , I guess for $ 400 a month I shouldn't expect an all bills paid apartment .",neutral
"Okay , here's the lease . Read it over before you sign it . As you can see , the deposit is $ 300 .",neutral
"Oh , okay . I can get it back when I move out , right ?",neutral

Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ?,neutral
"Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens .",neutral
How much more do I have to pay ?,neutral

"How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ?",neutral
"Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .",neutral
I never eat breakfast though .,neutral
"That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food .",neutral
I never thought about it that way .,neutral
"I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .",neutral
"Oh doctor , I feel so foolish .",negative
Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .,neutral

"hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .",neutral
"Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves .",neutral
"I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .",neutral
maybe ... I'll think about it .,neutral
"well , I think you should come and have some fun . Besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . You should at least try .",neutral
"Going to the gym tonight , Mary ?",neutral

Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings .,neutral
"Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .",neutral
"Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .",neutral
"I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .",neutral
"Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time .",neutral
What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ?,neutral
"Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair .",neutral
Yes .,neutral
"Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable .",neutral

That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise .,neutral
"But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter .",neutral
"Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .",neutral
"I know you're right , but what can I do ?",neutral
How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?,neutral
But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China .,neutral

"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ”",neutral
"Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite .",neutral
"I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ?",neutral
"The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ?",neutral
"Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits .",neutral
"It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ?",neutral
Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ”,neutral
Please lend me some money .,neutral
"OK , do you want it urgently ?",neutral
"Yeah , I really want it . I am on my uppers .",neutral
"Right , here you are .",neutral

I just enjoy watching games .,neutral
You really shouldn't watch so much television .,neutral
"Excuse me , sir , Is this the road to the peace Store ?",neutral

"Where's Wort Street , please ?",neutral

Where on earth are we ?,neutral
"Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .",neutral
What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?,neutral
"I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .",neutral

It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .,neutral

I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?,negative
"Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .",neutral
You need a babysitter .,neutral
"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .",neutral
I could have Suzy stay at my place .,neutral
"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",neutral
Why not ?,neutral
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,neutral
"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",neutral
"I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .",neutral
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .,neutral
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .,positive
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .,neutral
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .,positive
A friend told me I might find a room here .,neutral

Could you come back later ? We ’ re right in the middle of dinner .,neutral
I wonder if you can help me . I ’ m looking for a room .,neutral
Yes . I ’ Ve get a small room .,neutral
How much do you charge ?,neutral
"35.00 dollars a week , but I don ’ t allow smoking .",neutral
OK.Can I see the room now ?,neutral
Would you mind waiting ? I ’ m on the telephone .,neutral
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !,negative
"I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .",neutral
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !,negative
I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?,neutral
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .,neutral
"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",neutral
I don't know .,neutral
"I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .",neutral
What do you mean ?,neutral
"We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",neutral
I have plenty of gas .,neutral
"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",neutral
So what can we do ?,neutral
"Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",neutral
Alright . That's a good idea .,positive
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .,neutral
Days ?,neutral
"Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .",neutral
"Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .",positive
Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .,neutral
Do you take in students ?,neutral
"Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available .",neutral
How much is it ?,neutral
30.00 dollars a week .,neutral
"Do you think I could have a look at it , please .",neutral
I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ?,neutral
"What's happening , officer ?",neutral
There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately .,neutral
"What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here !",negative
Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely .,neutral
I can smell smoke !,negative
Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel .,neutral
OK .,neutral
Come with me .,neutral
"Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box .",neutral
Don't take your personal belongings . We need to get out of the building now !,neutral
Gosh ! I can see the flames !,negative
Crouch down and try not to breathe in the smoke .,neutral
"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",negative
What ? What did you buy ?,neutral
It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,negative
What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,neutral
"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .",neutral
And ?,neutral
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,neutral
And it's a brick ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,neutral
"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",neutral
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,neutral
"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",neutral
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,neutral
He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,neutral
"Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",neutral
"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",neutral
That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,neutral
"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?",neutral
What ? Your diamond ring is lost ?,neutral
"Yeah , I just cannot find it anywhere .",neutral
It must have been stolen by the few thieves . I ’ ll get it back for you .,neutral
You are risking your neck . Don ’ t you know they have guns .,neutral
"Don ’ t be angry with them . After all , they are still children .",neutral
But I am still worry about them . I ’ m afraid ...,neutral
"If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track .",neutral
"Well , I won ’ t put a crime into their doings .",neutral
You should not have criticize your son in front of his friends .,neutral
Why ? He did something wrong .,neutral
I know . But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds .,neutral
I only wanted to help him .,neutral
But it is not the right time .,neutral
"What a mess , Jack !",negative
"I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad .",neutral
"You ’ d better tidy up the room now , or you ’ ll get your mum ’ s back up .",neutral
The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching .,neutral
"Oh , yeah . We will have winter holiday .",neutral
How are you getting along with your studies ?,neutral
"Don ’ t worry , mum . I will study hard tomorrow .",neutral
But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice .,neutral
I have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children .,neutral
What is your problem ?,neutral
My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely .,neutral
You need not always do that . Why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ?,neutral
"Where is our son , dear ?",neutral
He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school .,neutral
What happened ? Have you talked with him ?,neutral
Yeah . He told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .,neutral
Ann ! Don ’ t you see the children are making so much noise here ? Why don ’ t you keep them occupied and out their mother ’ s hair ?,neutral
OK ! What about taking them outside and flying a kite .,neutral
"Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you .",positive
"Dad , can you buy a new camera ? My old one has gone west .",neutral
What ? I gave it to you only 3 months ago .,positive
"So , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . This time how about a better one ?",neutral
"Ok , son . I think I ’ Ve go to tell you the truth . My company has gone out and I ’ m now out of job . If you want a new camera , go and earn money yourself .",neutral
What are you doing ?,neutral
I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .,neutral
Let regive you a hand .,neutral
"No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .",neutral
"But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play .",neutral
What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk .,neutral
"Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them .",neutral
I really don ’ t know how to teach my son . He's getting far above himself .,neutral
You should send him to the boarding school . He need a strict teacher .,neutral
Maybe you are right . I will discuss it with my wife tonight .,neutral
"Jack , let ’ s go !",negative
"Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?",neutral
Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !,negative
Take it easy . They will get caught .,neutral
What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one .,negative
Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ?,neutral
"Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to but one today .",positive
I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ?,neutral
"Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit .",neutral
But each children has his own interest .,neutral
"Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision .",neutral
Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out .,neutral
"The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night .",neutral
But we need the exact time . What time ?,neutral
"Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside .",neutral
Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box .,neutral
I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ?,neutral
I think you are flicking through it .,neutral
"Well , wait a minute .",neutral
"Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late .",neutral
It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway .,neutral
"Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible .",neutral
I hope so .,neutral
Hello ?,neutral
"Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ?",neutral
"No , not out of order . But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . I can ’ t hear you clearly .",neutral
Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ?,neutral
Sure . Thanks .,positive
Can you help me now ?,neutral
"No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .",neutral
That'll be too late .,neutral
Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ?,neutral
"I did , but he wasn't able to either .",neutral
There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?,neutral
Use them from the outside in .,neutral
I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .,neutral
Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?,neutral
Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .,neutral
Let's look at our menus .,neutral
"Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .",neutral
"Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .",neutral
Why didn ’ t you call me last night ?,neutral
Because I went out .,neutral
Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ?,neutral
I didn ’ t have any change .,neutral
Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then .,neutral
I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why .,neutral
"Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook .",positive
I'm OK .,neutral
"I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?",neutral
"Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .",neutral
OK . Yeah ! Yeah !,positive
"First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .",neutral
"Oh , OK . Wow !",positive
"OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .",neutral
Wow . That sounds really good .,positive
What're you doing now ?,neutral
I'm watching TV .,neutral
You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed .,neutral
I will .,neutral
And don't ever forget it .,neutral
"You know , you really ought to get a new pair of jeans . Those are falling to pieces .",neutral
"But this is how I like them , Mum . They ’ re just beginning to look right .",neutral
"Well , you ’ d better get another pair for work at least or you ’ re sacking on the spot .",neutral
"Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ?",neutral
"Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?",neutral
"Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .",neutral
And must I go back to school ?,neutral
"No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .",neutral
"But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I'm nearly 17 .",neutral
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .,neutral
What else I've got to do ? Join the army ?,neutral
Who knows ! That might come to later .,neutral
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .,neutral
What part hurts ?,neutral
The shoulder .,neutral
"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .",neutral
It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .,negative
C'mon . Just don't move .,neutral
I'm bleeding too much .,negative
"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",neutral
"Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !",negative
"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",neutral
"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",neutral
Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,neutral
"No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",negative
"Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?",neutral
"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !",neutral
We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .,neutral

"He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .",neutral
"Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .",neutral
"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .",neutral
"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .",neutral
"It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .",neutral
"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .",neutral
"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .",neutral
"Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ?",neutral
I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles .,neutral
"I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes .",neutral
And what does your husband do ?,neutral
My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now .,neutral
"But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard .",neutral
"Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something .",neutral
"Wow , it has a balcony .",neutral

"Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook .",neutral

"OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .",neutral
OK . Yeah ! Yeah !,positive
"First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .",neutral
"Oh , OK . Wow !",positive
"OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .",neutral
Wow . That sounds really good .,positive
"Mm , it is .",neutral
Wow . What fillings do you recommend ?,neutral
"Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese .",neutral
"Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun .",positive

What would happen if they started attacking you ?,neutral
"You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive .",neutral

"It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food .",neutral

"Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides .",neutral
"Oh , then what would happen if there were pests ?",neutral

So let's go and catch earth worms !,positive
OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go .,neutral
"Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing .",neutral
"That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today .",neutral
I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?,neutral
"I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one .",neutral
"Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill .",positive
"Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?",positive
"Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about .",neutral
Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box .,neutral

The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera .,positive
"Dad , I'd like to take a picture with the status .",neutral
All right . Give me a big smile . Are you ready ? Cheese !,neutral
"Daddy , we can't have a photo of the whole family . We can take one here .",neutral
"Excuse me , sir . Could you take a photo for us ? Just press this button .",neutral
"Hey , look , there is a circus show over there .",neutral
I'm not in the mood .,neutral
It's the circus .,neutral
I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .,negative
"Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .",neutral
Cute ? Hope so .,positive
"Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .",neutral

I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .,negative
That's weird !,positive
"That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it .",neutral
"I wasn't kidding before , OK , I'm fine now .",neutral
"Honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now .",neutral
Yes .,neutral
"Now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters .",neutral
What are you saying ? You are acting weird today .,neutral
"I want to adopt a cat , and it can be Barbie's boyfriend too .",neutral
"Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me .",positive
That's all right . At least I got myself left .,neutral
"Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel .",neutral
I hope that he would grant me with that .,neutral
Hope so .,neutral
"Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ?",neutral
"Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month .",neutral
"Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks .",neutral
"Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ?",neutral
Can you recommend some must-try ?,neutral
"OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao .",neutral
What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny !,positive
"Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun .",neutral
"Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert .",positive
"Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings .",neutral
I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ?,neutral
"Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite !",positive
"Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us .",positive
"Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time .",neutral
It doesn't matter . But I really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time .,neutral
What did you do last weekend ?,neutral
It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano .,neutral
Did you play football with other children ?,neutral
"Ahh , I was not available last Sunday . I was too busy almost as much as you .",neutral

"Okay , it sounds good .",positive
The tea smells good . What tea is it ?,positive
It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province .,neutral
What's special about it except its pleasant smell ?,neutral
You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well .,neutral
They must have some special methods to do this during the process .,neutral
Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities .,neutral
"Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?",neutral
Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea .,neutral
What's the advantage about tea ?,neutral
"There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health .",neutral
Does that mean the stronger the better ?,neutral
No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong .,neutral
Got it . What's the proper time for tea ?,neutral
It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime .,neutral
Why ?,neutral
"It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold .",positive
"There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .",neutral
That's what I am going to do .,neutral
"If you have any problem , please come to me .",neutral
I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?,neutral
You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .,neutral
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?,neutral
Do you have any special request ?,neutral
I'd like to see some traditional arts .,neutral
So that means you are shopping for presents ?,neutral
"Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .",neutral
"Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .",neutral
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .,positive
"I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .",neutral
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .,neutral
"As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .",neutral
"Wow , you are the expert on it .",positive
"Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ?",neutral
Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower .,neutral
"Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ?",neutral
"You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online .",neutral
Are there many things online ?,neutral
Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online !,neutral
"Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ?",neutral
"Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here .",neutral

Let's click to check it out .,neutral
"Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .",positive
No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits .,neutral
Are there any disadvantages about it ?,neutral
It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon .,neutral
"Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ?",neutral
Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife .,neutral
Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it .,neutral
"Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture .",neutral
Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ?,neutral
Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant .,neutral
"Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ?",neutral
You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now .,neutral
I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ?,neutral
There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget .,neutral
"Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too .",neutral
It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ?,neutral
I'll take care of the order .,neutral
"OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ?",neutral
Don't forget about the dessert .,neutral
"OK , then 50 Yuan for dessert . 500 Yuan all together .",neutral
"Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ?",neutral
I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .,positive
"Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason .",neutral
Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .,positive
I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?,neutral
"Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that .",neutral
It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .,neutral
"Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?",neutral
"Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !",positive
"Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne .",neutral
"Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .",positive
It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .,neutral
"That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?",neutral
"No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft .",neutral
How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .,neutral
I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .,neutral
"Are you ready to order , sir ?",neutral
Yeah . I have a fancy for some wine tonight . Can you recommend something for me ?,neutral
Our red wine is very famous . I'd suggest you try that .,neutral
All right . What kind of red wine do you serve ?,neutral
Here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . You can have a taste then make your decision then . Here is the wine menu .,neutral
The dry red wine looks quite good . I'd like to try this one .,neutral
Then do you like any cheese to go with it ?,neutral
Why ? Do I have to order that ?,neutral
"Oh , no . But cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . And we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . Here are the pictures . Pick out something you like .",neutral
That's really nice . I'd like this one . It looks very attractive .,positive

"Medium , please ?",neutral
Anything for dessert ?,neutral
Sure . We'd like to have Black Forest Cake for dessert .,neutral
OK . Please wait for s while . We'll get it done quickly !,positive
What can I do for you ?,neutral
"I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash .",neutral
"OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned .",neutral
That's OK . But that must be costly .,neutral
"Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' .",neutral
"Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer .",positive
"Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually .",neutral
I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash .,neutral
Never mind . You can leave them to me .,neutral
"Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing .",positive
"It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know .",neutral
I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ?,neutral
That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice .,neutral
"Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice .",neutral
Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage .,neutral
I'm afraid that a button is missing .,neutral
I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon .,negative
"OK , please .",neutral
Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ?,neutral
"Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt .",positive
"It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think .",negative
"It's been several days now , I am not sure .",neutral
"Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go .",neutral
"Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ?",neutral
I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time .,negative
"OK , I will .",neutral
This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .,neutral
Thanks a lot .,positive
Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service .,positive
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .,neutral
"I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .",negative
Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?,neutral
Why not ? I'd love to do that .,positive
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .,neutral
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?,positive
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?,neutral
I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .,neutral
"No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .",neutral
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .,positive
"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .",neutral
Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?,neutral
"Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night .",neutral
It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?,neutral
Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .,neutral
What about the performance itself ?,neutral
"Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .",neutral
"Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .",neutral
It surely is . And the cast is really the best .,neutral
Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?,positive
"The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .",neutral
"Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .",positive
"I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .",positive
"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .",positive
Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .,neutral
See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .,neutral
"Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .",neutral
You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?,neutral
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .,neutral
"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?",neutral
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?,positive
"Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .",neutral
"Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .",neutral
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?,neutral
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .,neutral
"It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .",positive
Here we go .,neutral
"Can I help you , sir ?",neutral
"Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife .",neutral
What kind of presents do you want ?,neutral
"Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ?",neutral
"OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America .",neutral
"Hey , How did you know I came from America ?",positive
"Just a hunch , sir .",neutral
How much again ?,neutral
$ 59.95 .,neutral
"That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs .",positive
"Sorry , sir .",neutral
Why not ?,neutral
"Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .",neutral
"Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume .",neutral
That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY .,positive
DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ?,neutral
It's $ 60 here .,neutral
That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ?,positive
"Of course not , sir .",neutral
"OK , I'll take one .",neutral

"I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time .",positive
"Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty .",positive
We are nor alone here . So many other families !,positive
Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings .,positive
"Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn .",neutral
"OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff .",neutral
"Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ?",positive
"Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys .",neutral
Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ?,positive
He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do .,neutral
"Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science .",neutral
"Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic !",positive
I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world .,neutral
I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day .,neutral
"Well , OK . you are always right .",neutral
"What can I do for you , young man ?",neutral
I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning .,neutral
What sizes do you need ?,neutral
"One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids .",neutral
Here you are . And here are three crash helmets .,neutral
"Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?",positive
"Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .",neutral
"Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .",neutral
"That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .",neutral
OK . Anything else ?,neutral
Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .,neutral
"Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?",positive
I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done .,neutral
My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ?,positive
"Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again .",neutral
"What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat .",neutral
That was last time . This time it's worse .,neutral
"Ok , tell me .",neutral
"Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ...",neutral
And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time .,neutral
"True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ...",neutral
"Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad .",neutral
"And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish .",neutral
"At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad .",neutral
"Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald .",neutral
"Hmm , that is bad .",negative
"Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ?",neutral
"Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty .",neutral
Thank you .,positive
"You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ?",positive
Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today .,neutral
I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ?,neutral
"Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel .",positive
"I am going there , too . We can walk together .",neutral
Sure .,neutral
"Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ?",neutral
"Lily , I ’ m not sure . Let me check , I think I spent $ 50 .",neutral
Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money .,negative
"I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes .",neutral
I ’ m sorry . I guess I ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank .,neutral
"That ’ s okay . I ’ m sorry , too . It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities .",neutral
So how's everything going for Christmas ?,neutral
"I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with .",neutral
"What's that ? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours .",neutral
"No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus .",neutral
"He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ?",positive
Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ...,neutral
You think it's better that he should be told ?,neutral
"Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do .",neutral
That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real .,neutral
"I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son .",neutral
"Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that .",neutral
"Grandpa , this seat is for you , for you are the eldest person here and also it's your birthday today .",neutral
"Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me .",positive
"I'm afraid I can't do that . It's Dad's seat , according to the book about table manners .",neutral
"Oh , you read ? Very good . Then , I think we should do something different today . I'll give you some privilege .",neutral
Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake .,positive
Now I see what you read the book for . But it's fine . I'll give you the lion's share .,neutral
Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ?,neutral
This is not common noodles . They're “ long-lived ” noodles.it ' s an old Chinese tradition to eat.long - lived noodle on birthday .,neutral
I see . Then I'll try it .,neutral
Want to send out for some Chinese ?,neutral
Some what ?,neutral
"Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .",neutral
"No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?",neutral
"Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .",neutral
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?,neutral
"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .",neutral
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .,neutral
Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .,neutral
"Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ?",neutral
"I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot .",neutral
"Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn .",positive
"Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ?",neutral
I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola .,neutral
"Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional .",neutral
"Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ?",neutral
"The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ?",neutral
Sure . Is it sweet ?,neutral
"Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too .",neutral
"Great , I want it spicy .",positive
Come on . Don's go too far .,neutral
I want it to be special . And you know that I always like hot food .,neutral
OK then . We shall ask them to put some red chilli on it .,neutral
"Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late .",negative
It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway .,neutral
"Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible .",neutral
I hope so .,neutral
What ? Your golden watch is lost ?,positive
Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere .,neutral
It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black .,neutral
Let's get it back .,neutral
"Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .",positive
You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .,neutral
Are you serious ? How can that be ?,neutral
"Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .",neutral
"Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .",neutral
That's true . But I just love it . Come here !,neutral
"Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !",positive
You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .,positive
"Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase .",positive
"Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ?",positive
"Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please .",neutral
What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .,neutral
Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .,neutral
Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .,neutral
"Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .",neutral
Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .,positive
"Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ?",neutral
"Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match .",neutral
"OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific .",neutral
Of course . It's a newly-built one .,neutral
We are lucky to play in a new stadium .,positive
"Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting .",neutral
Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line .,neutral
"Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ?",positive
Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well .,neutral
"Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint .",neutral
"No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully .",neutral
Really ? You must be ...,positive
But that game he dunked over me for 13 times .,neutral
"That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half .",neutral
"Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down .",neutral
"He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor .",neutral
"Tom , is Jenny crying ?",neutral
I ’ m just coming for that .,neutral
She kept bothering me .,neutral
She ’ s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ’ t you be good to her ?,neutral
"But I am her brother , not her servant .",neutral
"Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ?",neutral
There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding .,neutral
Trust me . I've been driving for two years .,neutral
Ok . You drive and do be careful .,neutral
What can I do ?,neutral
The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet .,neutral
Did you go to any illegal website ?,neutral
"No , But does that matter ?",neutral
"Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that .",neutral
I see . I'd better never try .,neutral
That's wise .,neutral
Do you know what's wrong with my PC ?,neutral
"One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software .",neutral
Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ?,neutral
Of course . You'd better learn something about it .,neutral
I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ?,neutral
"Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ?",neutral
"Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that .",positive
What did the boss say ?,neutral
He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ?,neutral
You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that .,neutral
"Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job .",neutral
"Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ?",neutral
It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday .,neutral
Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers .,positive
"That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences .",positive
And a good way to get some pocket money .,positive
Let's do it together .,neutral
I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card .,neutral
"For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ?",neutral
"Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive .",neutral
"Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman .",neutral
"Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first .",neutral
"Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ?",neutral
"But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .",neutral
How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?,neutral
There are four more stops .,neutral
"Oh , my God !",positive
"What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !",neutral
Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?,neutral
"No , not on the train , but in the station .",neutral
Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?,neutral
"Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?",neutral
"Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .",neutral
I guess you'll never forget today .,neutral
"Excuse me ? Can you do me a favor , please ?",neutral
"It's my pleasure , what can I do for you ?",positive
I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today .,neutral
What brings you here ?,neutral
I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation .,neutral
Where are you staying ?,neutral
I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel .,neutral
"Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place .",neutral
"Yes , it is . Do you know where I can get a town map ?",neutral
"We sell them , right here .",neutral
"Great , do you have any for foreigners ? I mean English version ?",positive
"Daniel , here is some money for the tickets .",neutral
"OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ?",positive
"Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people .",neutral
But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets .,neutral
They may unless we get a half-price ticket for you .,neutral
"Dad , it makes no sense .",neutral
You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket .,neutral
"Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan .",neutral
"I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first .",neutral
Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ?,positive
"Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there .",neutral
"OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move .",neutral
How much will it cost in that case ?,neutral
"Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please .",neutral
"Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving .",neutral
"No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving .",neutral
The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ?,neutral
"OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department .",neutral
That was really a nightmare !,negative
"Honey , what's up ?",neutral
I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .,negative
"Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?",positive
I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .,negative
Did you panic at the time ?,neutral
"A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .",neutral
Was there anyone else with you ?,neutral
"Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .",neutral
So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?,neutral
Yes . I have to call the property management .,neutral
For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?,neutral
"Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .",neutral
That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .,neutral
"I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .",neutral
"Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ?",neutral
What ?,neutral
"I said , I'm Ted , who are you ?",neutral
"Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura .",neutral
"Do you come here often , Laura ?",neutral
"Huh ? I can't hear you , the music's too loud .",neutral
"Let's go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ?",neutral
"Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ?",neutral
I asked if you come here often .,neutral
"Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ?",neutral
"No , this is my first time here .",neutral
"I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time .",positive
"Yeah , that's why I'm here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying .",neutral
"That's good . It's good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while .",positive
"I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don't mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I'll do it in a park .",neutral
Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?,neutral
"I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .",neutral
Are you having any luck ?,neutral
Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .,neutral
Do you mind if I go with you ?,neutral
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .,neutral
"I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .",neutral
What happened ?,neutral
"I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .",neutral
So what do you think of my new dress ?,neutral
"I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .",positive
"Um , ninety-five dollars ?",neutral
"Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?",neutral
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .,neutral
"Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?",neutral
"I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .",neutral
"Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .",neutral
I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday .,neutral
"They spend hours there , especially on weekends .",neutral
"Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?",neutral
I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?,neutral
Isn't that complicated ?,neutral
"No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund .",neutral
We ? Do you want to go with me ?,neutral
Sure . I love going to the mall .,positive
"What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?",neutral
"Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?",neutral
"Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .",neutral
"Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .",neutral
That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .,neutral
"What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?",neutral
"Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .",neutral
"So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?",neutral
"Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .",neutral
"Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .",neutral
"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .",neutral
"Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ?",neutral
"No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ?",neutral
You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ?,positive
"No , Officer , not at all .",neutral
Then how can you explain your behavior ?,neutral
"Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer .",neutral
Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ?,neutral
"Um , because I was busy talking to my friend .",neutral
On a cell phone ?,neutral
"Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions .",neutral
That's definitely true . I'm going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time .,neutral
Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small .,neutral
I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper .,neutral
A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop .,neutral
Here ’ s an interesting ad,neutral
How much is the rent ?,neutral
The ad says $ 325 plus deposit .,neutral
When is the place available ?,neutral
"It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work .",neutral
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City .,positive
"Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ?",neutral
"Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here .",neutral
I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York .,neutral
Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live .,positive
"Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .",neutral
Can you tell me how to reach the bank please ?,neutral
"Which bank ? There are two , the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland .",neutral
I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank .,neutral
"You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre , Dunned Stores .",neutral
How do I get there . I have no knowledge of this area .,neutral
Cross the road and turn left at the other side . Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left .,neutral
It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ?,neutral
It's not so complicated . It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish .,neutral
"Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ?",neutral
You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area .,neutral
What does a housing go for in south mountain district ?,neutral
It depends on the type of the house you're looking for .,neutral
We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home .,neutral
What ’ s your general price range ?,neutral
"Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose .",neutral
"Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest .",neutral
What about a two-bedroom house ?,neutral
"A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB .",neutral
I see .,neutral
"I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family .",neutral
"Okay , I will take it into consideration .",positive
"Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?",neutral
I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .,neutral
"Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?",neutral
"Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .",neutral
So this would be your first automobile ?,neutral
"That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .",neutral
"Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .",neutral
"Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .",neutral
"So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !",positive
"Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .",neutral
Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .,neutral
I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .,neutral
"Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?",neutral
"Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .",neutral
I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .,neutral
"This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum .",negative
"Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once .",neutral
That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ?,positive
"Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly .",neutral
How long will it take ?,neutral
It depends .,neutral
I need to talk it over with my wife .,neutral
Certainly .,neutral
I heard you are looking for a house .,neutral
Yes .,neutral
How is this going ?,neutral
I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet .,neutral
I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer .,neutral
Where is the house ?,neutral
It is on Spring Avenue .,neutral
Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ?,positive
It ’ s $ 240 a month .,neutral
Does that include utilities ?,neutral
"It includes water , but not gas and electricity .",neutral
That ’ s a little expensive .,neutral
But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work .,neutral
Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ?,neutral
"Yes , it is .",neutral
That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ?,neutral
Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first .,neutral
All right ! Thank you .,positive
Are you looking for an apartment ?,neutral
"Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square .",neutral
I think I have just a right apartment for you .,neutral
"Oh , good . Can you describe it ?",neutral
"Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens .",neutral
So is there a refrigerator ?,neutral
"Yes , it ’ s brand-new .",neutral
It sounds great . How much is the rent ?,neutral
It ’ s $ 8.50 a month .,neutral
When can I see it ?,neutral
We can take a see by there now if you like . The landlord left me a set of keys with me .,neutral
"Ok , that would be great .",positive
"Hello , Matt !",neutral
"Hello , Todd !",neutral
"Matt , I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question , do you have a pet ?",neutral
"Yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people .",neutral
"Wow , like how do they train the dogs ?",neutral
"How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school .",neutral
"Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ?",neutral
"Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training .",neutral
"Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ?",neutral
"Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile .",neutral
"Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ?",positive
"I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what .",positive
"Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ?",neutral
"Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they .",neutral
"Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving .",neutral
"We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out .",neutral
Out ? What do you mean out ?,positive
"You know on a date , they are going out to dinner .",neutral
Dad and mom ?,neutral
"Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition .",neutral
You mean this is going to be a regular thing ?,neutral
"That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ?",neutral
I'm sorry I'm so late . I had a really bad day .,negative
It's ten after six.We ' re late.But dinner is at six thirty .,neutral
I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag .,negative
I'll call the lost and found office .,neutral
I didn't think of it.Thank you.And I do apologize for being late .,negative
Is there anything wrong ?,neutral
I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .,neutral
Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .,neutral
I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .,neutral
You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .,neutral
But I just want to give her some tips .,neutral
"Oh , she can make her own decisions .",neutral
I guess you are right .,neutral
Believe me . Everything will be ok .,neutral
I hope so .,neutral
"Hi , Jone , how are you ?",neutral
Terrible .,negative
What's wrong ?,neutral
Someone robbed my apartment last week . The robber took $ 550 .,neutral
"Oh , no ! Did you call the police ?",positive
No .,neutral
Why not ?,neutral
My English isn't very good . I didn't know what to say to them .,neutral
"I'm going to give you some advice , Jone.If this happens again , you should call the police immediately . You should try to remember everything . You should explain everything to the police .",neutral
"You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?",neutral
Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher .,neutral
"Oh , what ’ s she like ?",neutral
She is beautiful .,positive
Is she old or young ?,neutral
She is quite young and her hair is blond .,positive

Not really . Her eyes are blue .,positive
Can she speak Chinese ?,neutral
Not much . She is very tall and slim .,positive
"David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework .",neutral
Excuse me .,neutral
"Yes , sir . Can I help you ?",neutral
"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare .",neutral
"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order .",neutral
"Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?",neutral
"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .",neutral
"Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much .",positive
Would you like to see our new shirts ?,neutral
"Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things .",neutral
"But they ’ re very nice , you know .",neutral
Really .,neutral
And not expensive either .,neutral
"Oh , I don ’ t care about that .",neutral
Everybody is buying them .,neutral
Are they ?,neutral
"Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see .",neutral
I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion .,neutral
I see .,neutral
But thank you very much all the same .,positive
"Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you .",negative
"Please show me the menu , Miss .",neutral
Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ?,neutral
Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles .,neutral
All right . Can I serve you anything else ?,neutral

"You've got it , sir .",neutral
"Excuse me , I'd like to make a suit of this material .",neutral

An apartment ? Why ?,positive
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .,neutral
Where are you living now ?,neutral
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .,neutral
How are you going to find an apartment ?,neutral
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .,neutral
Apartments in the city are expensive .,neutral
"I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .",neutral
"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .",neutral
"Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .",neutral
But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .,neutral
But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .,neutral
"Well , only you liked it really , darling .",neutral
"Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .",positive
"Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ?",neutral
"No , I assure you .",neutral
"And you'll repair the television , won't you ?",neutral
Ok .,neutral
Do you promise ?,neutral
Of course .,neutral
"And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ?",neutral
I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise .,neutral
"But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ?",neutral
Yes . But only if you ask me nicely .,neutral
"Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please !",neutral
Ok . I'll keep my promise .,neutral
Hi . You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . What would you like me to do ?,neutral
"Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler .",positive
"Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV !",neutral
"After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it .",neutral
Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?,neutral
"These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add .",neutral
Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ?,neutral
"Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan .",neutral
Right . What are you doing over there ?,neutral
I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe !,neutral
"Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ?",neutral
Promise you are not going to be angry ?,neutral
"Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ?",neutral
I forgot .,neutral
You forgot ? You ...,positive
"Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?",neutral
Are you ready to go shopping ?,neutral
Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .,neutral
"Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?",neutral
I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?,neutral
Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?,neutral
"Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ?",neutral
I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .,neutral
What kind of cheese do you want .,neutral
"I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?",neutral

"I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .",neutral
"Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .",neutral
"So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?",neutral
"Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .",neutral
Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?,positive
"No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .",neutral
You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .,neutral

Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .,neutral
It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?,neutral

Good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company .,neutral
Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .,positive
When did it first break down ?,neutral
About ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating .,neutral
"Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .",neutral

"Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .",neutral
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .,neutral
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !,positive
It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ...,neutral

Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .",positive
What about all these other pieces ?,neutral
"See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .",positive
And these two ? They are husband and wife ?,neutral
"That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ?",positive
Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation !,negative

I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ?,neutral
There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .,neutral
I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .,neutral
Which tests do you mean ?,neutral
You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”,neutral
"Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .",neutral
"Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .",neutral
Your dog is so much fun . He ’ s so playful . I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does .,neutral
Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs . How old is your cat now ? you ’ Ve had her longer than we ’ Ve had our dog .,neutral
"She ’ s eight years old . She ’ s getting quite old . Your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ?",neutral
Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day !,positive
I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home .,neutral
"Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ?",positive
"She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse .",neutral
Have you ever thought about having another pet ?,neutral
The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat !,neutral
What are you reading ?,neutral
"Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .",neutral
I thought he usually wrote horror books .,positive
He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .,neutral
We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?,neutral
"Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .",neutral
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .,neutral

Are you having any dessert ?,neutral
"I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight .",neutral
What game do you like ?,neutral
I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .,neutral
"I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .",neutral
"It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .",neutral
I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?,neutral
"I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money .",neutral
Do you play bridge ?,neutral
"Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .",neutral
"I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?",neutral
"Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .",neutral
I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours .,neutral
"I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ?",neutral
"Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .",neutral
"I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?",neutral
Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?,neutral
"Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .",neutral
"We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .",neutral
That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?,positive
"Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?",neutral
I like the red one . What do they eat ?,neutral
"You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .",neutral
Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .,positive
That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .,neutral
I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath .,neutral
I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy .,negative
"I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit .",neutral
Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ?,neutral
I smoke around 30 each day .,neutral
"Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far .",neutral
"If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline .",neutral
Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition .,neutral
"I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill .",neutral
Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet .,neutral
Hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . What exercises are you going to do today ?,neutral
I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless .,neutral
Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time .,neutral
Sure . Is today only you second visit ?,neutral
"Yes , it is . I'll be coming here regularly . I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape .",neutral
"The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later .",neutral
I was told that the first time I came heer . I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . I need to build up slowly .,neutral
"That's right . You don't want to injure yourself by exercising too much or in the wrong way . Now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ...",neutral
What do we need for the barbecue ?,neutral
"Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties .",neutral
I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ?,positive
I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up !,neutral
"And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .",neutral
They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes .,neutral
I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce .,neutral
"I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop .",neutral
How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ?,neutral
It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked .,neutral
They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it .,neutral
I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians !,neutral
Do you like cooking ?,neutral
I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ?,positive
"I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .",neutral
You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .,neutral
"So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .",neutral
"Italian , Indian , and Chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice .",neutral
Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?,neutral
"Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .",neutral
How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ?,neutral
"Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .",neutral
Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?,neutral
"We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef . You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ?",neutral
"Yes , we do . We also eat a lot of lamb .",neutral
yes . I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops .,neutral
That ’ s right . They tastes so good ! We eat them with mint sauce . Have you every tried them ?,positive
"Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty . Can you cook them ?",neutral
"I certainly can . If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you .",positive
That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine .,positive
Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !,negative
You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .,neutral
Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !,neutral
No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .,neutral
But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !,negative
"You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .",neutral
"Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .",neutral
"I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?",neutral
Thanks mom !,positive
"It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland .",positive
"Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .",positive
"The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !",positive
"Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play .",positive
"It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .",positive
"Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .",positive
"Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland .",positive
"We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall !",positive
"He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track .",positive
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go !,positive
"Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead !",positive
"How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag !",positive
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?,neutral
"Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ?",neutral
No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?,neutral
"Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop .",neutral
I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .,positive
"I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .",neutral
"So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .",neutral
Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .,positive
Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .,neutral
Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card .,neutral
Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine .,positive
The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?,positive
I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .,neutral
"So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?",neutral
"Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .",neutral
How long did it take you to do the tiling .,neutral
"As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .",neutral
I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?,positive
"You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .",positive
Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?,neutral
"Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .",positive
"I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ?",neutral
Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain .,neutral
I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?,neutral
Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?,neutral
It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square metres .,neutral
I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better .,neutral
Ok . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .,positive
I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ?,neutral
I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ?,positive
I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .,neutral
New furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table .,neutral
Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?,neutral
That wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ?,neutral
Yes . I have some many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore .,neutral
I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition .,positive
"That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy .",positive
I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day .,neutral
Ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes .,neutral
I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ?,neutral
"That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room .",positive
I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe .,neutral
You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom .,neutral
"Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though .",positive
Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store .,neutral
Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .,neutral
You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work .,neutral
That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .,positive
Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ?,neutral
"Yes , we do . The most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ?",neutral
"I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds .",positive
Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ?,neutral
"We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant .",neutral
"I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often .",positive
Why is it relatively expensive ?,neutral
Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries .,neutral
"I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country .",neutral
"We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket .",neutral
"Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine .",positive
A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables .,neutral
Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time .,neutral
"Ok , what do you want me to do ?",neutral
"First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish .",neutral
"Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .",neutral
We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .,neutral
"While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meal , by the way .",neutral
"Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .",positive
My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?,positive
Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .,neutral
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .,neutral
Have you seen Bill recently ?,neutral
"Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now .",neutral
Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood .,neutral
"You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ?",neutral
"He ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold .",neutral
"He might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy .",neutral
"I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .",neutral
"It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look .",positive
"Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling .",neutral
That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .,positive
"Yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon .",neutral
"How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?",neutral
It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .,neutral
Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .,neutral
You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .,neutral
"Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?",neutral
"Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .",neutral
"I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?",neutral
That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .,neutral
"These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .",positive
I ’ d like to send this parcel to Australia .,neutral
"Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ?",neutral
Sure . It ’ s not very heavy .,neutral
That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it .,neutral
I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail .,neutral
That ’ s right . Sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars .,neutral
How long will it take to get there ?,neutral
Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks .,neutral
"It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel .",neutral
No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra .,positive
Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars .,positive
There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye .,positive

I seem to have lost my train ticket .,neutral
What ’ s your destination ?,neutral
I ’ m supposed to be going to shanghai .,neutral
Ok . When is your train supposed to leave ?,neutral
It ’ s supposed to leave in 30 minutes .,neutral
"OH , dear . What ’ s your last name , please ?",neutral
S M I T H .,neutral
And your passport number ?,neutral
Z3264356 .,neutral
Let me see ... it doesn ’ t look like we have any information about your ticket here .,neutral
"Is there anything you can do for me ? If I don ’ t make it to shanghai in time , my wife is going go kill me .",neutral
"Oh dear . I ’ m really sorry , sir . But you don ’ t have any proof of purchase . You ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket .",neutral
How much is that going to cost me ?,neutral
"It depends on how you want to travel . If you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 RIB , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100RMB .",neutral
I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours !,negative
looks like you might like the soft sleeper then .,neutral
"Yes , fine . Let me see how much money I have in my wallet .",neutral
... sir ?,neutral
Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet !,positive
Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket .,neutral
You ’ re right . It is . Let me have a look . I have 419.6 RIB . is that enough ?,neutral
"You ’ re just 4 mao short for the hard sleeper , but I ’ ll let it go . Anything for love !",neutral
"Thanks , ma ’ am . You ’ re a lifesaver !",positive
Good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ?,neutral
Yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please .,neutral
Certainly . For how many people ?,neutral
We ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ?,neutral
I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ?,neutral
About 7 thirty .,neutral
Yes . That ’ s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . Could you give me your name please ?,neutral
My name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7 thirty on Friday .,neutral
Yes . Do you intend to order a Lacarne or will you be having our seafood buffet ?,neutral
"Oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good .",positive
"Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport .",neutral
"Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left .",neutral
"No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction .",neutral
Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway .,negative
How far is that ?,neutral
It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south .,neutral
"According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London .",neutral
"That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far .",neutral
Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !,neutral
"Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 .",neutral
Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ?,neutral
The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ?,neutral
"22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?",neutral
It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way .,neutral
We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late .,neutral
"Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ?",neutral
I'm afraid I can't .,negative
Why ?,neutral
"Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .",neutral
Could it be the battery ?,neutral
"No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .",neutral
"Well , I suppose it could be the gas .",neutral
"No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .",neutral
Perhaps it's the starter then ?,neutral
"Yes , that's possible .",neutral
"Excuse me , can you tell me the way to Holton railway station ?",neutral
"Sure . It ’ s quite far from here . Don ’ t worry , though . It ’ s not difficult to get there .",neutral
"I think I ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t ?",neutral
"Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ?",neutral
"Yes , I do . They are about two miles away , right ?",neutral
"That ’ s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ’ s a really big hotel . You can ’ t miss it . Turn left at the hotel .",neutral
"So , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . Got it .",neutral
Then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you .,neutral
Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help .,positive
No problem .,positive
Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful .,neutral
"Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting .",neutral
You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful .,neutral
"Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened .",negative
"Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse .",negative

Come on ! It's time to go !,neutral
"Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?",neutral
"Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .",neutral
That won't take long .,neutral
"Well , it won't if there no line at the pump .",neutral
"Well , I'm not quite ready .",neutral
"I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !",negative
You wouldn't do a thing like that !,neutral
"Oh , yes , I would !",negative
Why aren't you doing your homework ?,neutral
"I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday .",neutral
"Oh , is it ? You'll be making records next , will you ?",neutral

You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday .,neutral

"Thanks for the warning , Mom .",positive
"I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide .",neutral
"Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 .",neutral
"I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference .",neutral
"Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?",neutral
"I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad .",neutral
Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ?,neutral

I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .,neutral
Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .,neutral
I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .,neutral
You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .,neutral
But I just want to give her some tips .,neutral
"Oh , she can make her own decisions .",neutral
I guess you are right .,neutral
Believe me . Everything will be ok .,neutral
I hope so .,neutral
"Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house .",neutral
But yesterday you said you would rent it .,neutral
I ’ Ve changed my mind .,neutral
Why is that ?,neutral
"Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work .",neutral
Maybe you ’ re right .,neutral
"You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?",neutral

"I ’ m sorry , Jim .",negative
"Never mind , dear .",neutral
"Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ?",neutral
"Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?",neutral
"Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .",neutral
And must I go back to school ?,neutral
"No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .",neutral
"But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .",neutral
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .,neutral
What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?,neutral
Who knows ! That might come to later .,neutral
I am so busy today .,neutral
Can I help you ?,neutral
I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .,neutral
I ’ ll be glad to help .,positive
Or maybe make the beds .,neutral
All you have to do is ask for help .,positive
Thanks . That ’ s terrific !,positive
I ’ m ready and willing to help .,positive
"Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?",neutral
Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe .,neutral
What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing .,positive
Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion .,neutral
What am I going to do ?,neutral
Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .,neutral
"Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ?",neutral
"That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you .",positive
"Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ?",neutral
"Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ?",neutral
"Dreadful . There , the door is open now .",neutral
Thank you .,positive

"Oh , breaktime flies .",negative
"come on , baby . It ’ s time now .",neutral
"Mam , another minute , could I ?",neutral
"Hurry up , little boy .",neutral
"Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ?",neutral
"Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ?",neutral
"I'd like to see the menu . Would you get me one , please ?",neutral

Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ?,positive

"I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ?",negative
"All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir .",neutral
Mike ! Look at the floor !,neutral
What's wrong with it ?,neutral
What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !,positive
Oh ...,neutral
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .,negative
"Sorry , love .",negative
What are you looking for now ?,neutral
My cigarettes .,neutral
"Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .",neutral
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?,positive
Would you like to come by and play bridge ?,neutral
"Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .",neutral
"Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .",neutral
"Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .",neutral
"Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?",neutral
"Well , do you have any suggestions ?",neutral
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?,neutral
"It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .",neutral
"Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .",neutral
OK .,neutral
"Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?",neutral
Here's the dress you wanted to be made .,neutral
"Oh , dear !",positive
What's the matter ?,neutral
It's not what I asked for .,neutral
What's wrong with it ?,neutral
It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it .,neutral
This is a pity !,negative
"So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?",neutral
"Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .",neutral
That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .,neutral
Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .,neutral
Did you buy new cupboards too ?,neutral
"No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .",neutral
I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .,neutral
"Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .",neutral
"Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food .",neutral
"Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food .",neutral
"Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket .",neutral
I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig !,neutral
Sorry . What was that you said ?,neutral
I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven .,neutral
Where ?,neutral
At the Gate .,neutral
"When , did you say ?",neutral
Round about seven .,neutral
Who's coming ?,neutral
"Peter . Peter Brown , you know . Don't forget to bring the letter .",neutral
Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There's a lot of noise outside .,neutral
I told you not to forget to bring the letter .,neutral
"Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy .",neutral
We'd like to rent a flat near the university .,neutral
Are you looking for somewhere for two people ?,neutral
"Yes , we are . Obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month .",neutral
"Yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . Do you have any other requirements ?",neutral
"Not really , no . We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street .",neutral
How many rooms do you need in the flat ?,neutral
We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .,neutral
"Ok . I've got a list of place that fit your requirements . Let's just go through them . The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university .",neutral
How far away is it from the campus ?,neutral
"It's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a main street .",neutral
That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision .,positive
Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there .,positive
Thank you . That would be great .,positive
Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ?,neutral
"Yes , ma'ma . There'll be no problem with the quality .",neutral
What if there's something wrong with it ?,neutral
You don't have to worry about it . We have a one year warranty .,neutral
Are you sure ?,neutral
Sure . We have a good after-sale service . Your satisfaction is guaranteed .,neutral
What kind of place shall we rent ?,neutral
"It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .",neutral
Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .,neutral
"Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .",neutral
"I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .",neutral
"Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .",positive
"Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .",neutral
How much do you think the rent will be ?,neutral
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .,neutral
I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?,neutral
Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .,neutral
"I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony .",positive
The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .,positive
"Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks .",positive
It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .,negative
"Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine .",neutral
The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too .,positive
"Yes , everything has been well designed .",positive
"So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ?",neutral
"Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !",positive
"So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ?",neutral
"Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen .",neutral
What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook .,neutral
That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large .,neutral
Are the rooms nice and bright ?,neutral
"Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows .",neutral
Do you have a balcony ?,neutral
"No , we don ’ t . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .",neutral
"You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ?",neutral
"It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ?",positive
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?,negative
"You look a bit pale , don't you ?",neutral
"Yes , I can't sleep well every night .",negative
You should get plenty of sleep .,neutral
I drink a lot of wine .,negative
"If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .",neutral
I often feel so tired .,negative
You better do some exercise every morning .,neutral
I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .,negative
"Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .",neutral
Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?,neutral
"Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .",neutral
I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?,neutral
One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !,neutral
"When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?",neutral
"You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .",neutral
What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?,neutral
One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .,neutral
So I need plenty of space for this exercise .,neutral
"Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .",neutral
Great . Thanks for you advice !,positive
"Mum , can I finish my homework later ?",neutral
Sorry . You know the rules .,neutral
But I want to watch TV now .,neutral
That ’ s out of the question .,neutral
Please .,neutral
Not a chance .,neutral
Not even for an hour ?,neutral
"Sorry , it ’ s impossible .",neutral
I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ?,neutral
"No , I haven ’ t .",neutral
I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it .,neutral
Perhaps you left that at school .,neutral
"No , I had it when I left school this afternoon .",neutral
Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there .,neutral
"Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now .",neutral
But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library .,neutral
Perhaps I should call her later .,neutral
Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is .,neutral
Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment .,neutral
Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair .,neutral
Does he have a moustache or a beard ?,neutral
"Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard .",neutral
"Sounds like Mike , is it ?",neutral
"Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know .",neutral
"Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are .",neutral
Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that .,neutral
"Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree .",neutral
"I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information .",neutral
"She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too .",neutral
This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is .,neutral
She ’ s your mother !,neutral
How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ?,positive
"I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now .",neutral
I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality .,neutral
"Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me !",neutral
Shall we have some soup first ?,neutral
"No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with .",neutral
"Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ?",neutral
"Meat , I think .",neutral
Don't you like fish then ?,neutral
"I do , but I want meat .",neutral
Shall we have some white wine then ?,neutral
"Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat .",neutral
What would you like for dessert ?,neutral
"I just want to have a coffee , I think .",neutral
"Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ?",neutral
"No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired .",neutral
Excuse me .,neutral
"Yes , sir . Can I help you ?",neutral
"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare .",neutral
"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order .",neutral
"Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?",neutral
"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .",neutral
"Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much .",positive
You say he was around average hight .,neutral
"Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten .",neutral
Weight ?,neutral
"I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side .",neutral
Any marks on his face ?,neutral

Glasses ?,neutral
No .,neutral
what about his hair ?,neutral
Black or dark brown .,neutral
Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ?,neutral
"Straight , I think , and about average length .",neutral
"Boy , this surely doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing .",neutral
"Well , he had a jacked or a plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear .",neutral
"Ok , now we are getting some where . Pants ?",neutral
"Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure .",neutral
What kind of shoes ?,neutral
Boots,neutral
Cow while Boots .,neutral
"No , hiking boots . Brown ones .",neutral
All right . That Nealy done a little .,neutral
Now I want you to look some pictures .,neutral
There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .,neutral
Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .,neutral
I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound .,neutral
"Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .",neutral
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .,neutral
Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration .,neutral
"Yes , sir . May I help you ?",neutral
Please I'd like a ticket to New York .,neutral
For today ?,neutral
"No , early saturday morning .",neutral
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ?,neutral
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty .,neutral
"I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .",negative
"No , exactly not .",neutral
How about afternoon ?,neutral
Sounds not good . I won't take it .,neutral
Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ?,neutral
"No , I'll have the fish please .",neutral
The chicken is also nice .,neutral
"No , I want the fish .",neutral
Our special tonight is lobster .,neutral
"Thank you , but I prefer the fish .",neutral
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .,neutral
"No , I like the fish .",neutral
What ever you say ?,neutral
"Excuse me , sir ?",neutral
Yes ?,neutral
I'm afraid you can't smoke here .,neutral
Why not ?,neutral
Can't you see the notes here ?,neutral
I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say .,negative
It says ' No smoking ' .,neutral
"Sorry , I'm very near sighted .",negative
Are you going out again ?,neutral
"Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad .",neutral
You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine .,neutral
"Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ?",neutral
No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night .,neutral
"Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over .",negative
OK . Here's the key . Take care .,neutral
"I will . Thank you , dad .",positive
How beautiful the flower is !,positive
"Really , it's so beautiful .",positive
"You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .",positive
You mustn't pick it in this place .,neutral
Where it is ?,neutral
It's a private garden .,neutral
"I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .",neutral
"Well , I have got a vacancy .",neutral
What sort of price are you asking ?,neutral
Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .,neutral
Would it be convenient to see the room ?,neutral
Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch .,neutral
Good morning . May I help you ?,neutral
"Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .",neutral
"All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?",neutral
My name's Donald Eakins .,neutral
"How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .",neutral

It's 1446 Pine Street .,neutral
"1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?",neutral
"Yes , it is .",neutral
Good morning ! May I help you ?,neutral
Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .,neutral
Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?,neutral
Furnished .,neutral
Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?,neutral
"No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .",neutral
I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .,negative
"My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ?",neutral
"Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .",neutral
"Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?",neutral
"Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?",neutral
"No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?",neutral
"Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?",neutral
It says ' Keep off the grass ! ',neutral
"Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .",neutral

No !,neutral
Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .,negative
"Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .",neutral
"I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .",neutral
"Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .",neutral
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .,negative
"It's nothing personal , just business .",neutral
I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee .,negative
True . I always see him drinking instant .,neutral
Let's take him some of Kitty's best and make the pitch again .,neutral
Do you think that will be enough to make him have a change of heart ?,neutral
It's worth a shot .,neutral
"Johnny , I want to thank you .",positive
"What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ?",neutral
"Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy .",positive
"Well , it's more like she kept me busy ...",neutral
"I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you .",positive
Am I back in your good books ?,neutral
"Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all !",positive
"Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning .",neutral
"No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ?",neutral
It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ?,neutral
"That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ?",neutral
I'm done . Can I watch TV ?,neutral
Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol .,neutral
"Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom !",negative
Your throat must be swollen .,neutral
Do I have to take them ?,neutral
"Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup .",neutral
Yuck !,negative
"I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad .",neutral
I am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . I was wondering about the size .,neutral
It's a small .,neutral
How is the condition ? How old is it ?,neutral
It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it .,neutral
Why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ?,neutral
I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you !,positive
Mom !,positive
What are you doing ?,neutral
I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this !,positive
"You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu !",positive
But I feel better .,neutral
"Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ?",neutral
OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ...,neutral
"Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids .",positive
Good for you . Did you use Paypal ?,positive
"Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out .",neutral
"That's the beauty of it , and the danger .",positive
I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera .,neutral
How much ?,neutral
Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months .,neutral
"Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck .",positive
Ouch ! The water's too hot !,negative
"Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup .",neutral
"I'm not hungry , Mom .",neutral
"I know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . You'll get too weak if you don't eat .",neutral
Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ?,negative
"That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ?",neutral
"Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment .",positive
My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ?,positive
"The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume .",neutral
"No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping .",neutral
That's another one thousand six hundred ?,neutral
"Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door .",neutral
You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !,positive
Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing .,positive
That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing .,positive
Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !,positive
"Come on baby , let's dance !",positive
Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down !,positive
"Sorry to bother you so early . There's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but I thought I'd ask you first .",neutral
That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it .,positive
"I thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . So why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details .",neutral
OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ?,neutral
Great . See you then .,positive
My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month .,neutral
And this espresso looks like ... oil !,neutral
"It still tastes fine , though .",neutral
"These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it .",neutral
Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ”,positive
So how long do you plan to live here ?,neutral
"We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK .",neutral
Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ?,neutral
Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops .,neutral
"Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do .",positive
"We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers .",neutral
That about does it . See you in a week .,positive
"That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .",neutral
I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .,neutral
That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .,neutral
"Sure , for at least three thousand per month .",neutral
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .,neutral
"I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .",positive
"Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days .",neutral
Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water .,neutral
Sounds a little weak .,neutral
Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee .,neutral
"Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head .",positive
"Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time .",neutral
Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ?,neutral
Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again .,neutral
"I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign .",neutral
"As long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , I'll be alright for a while . You got your espresso , Jess ?",neutral
"Balista , I'll have a frappuccino .",neutral
What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ...,neutral
You and your fancy Italian names .,neutral
"Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini .",neutral
"I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much .",positive
And I'll stick with real coffee .,neutral
This motor oil case is still really slippery .,neutral
"Yeah , time for more coffee !",positive
"Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too .",neutral
"By the way , I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain .",neutral
So what ?,neutral
It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ?,positive
Then I'll have to borrow it .,neutral
Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month .,neutral
Why ? It's in mint condition !,negative
That's why I can profit from it !,neutral
You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ?,neutral
You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ...,neutral
I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me !,negative
"This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet .",positive
Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room .,neutral
You never know when two might turn into three .,neutral
I guess you're right . And we'd like to have company anyway .,neutral
"Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms .",positive
Now that's a plus !,positive
"Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .",neutral
So what about the tennis racket ?,neutral
Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !,positive
How much did that end up costing you ?,neutral
Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !,neutral
"Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .",positive
And here's her signature !,positive
So the apartment comes unfurnished ?,neutral
"This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture .",neutral
We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners .,neutral
This building is only four years old . It was built with central air .,neutral
Just like in the States ! That's perfect !,positive
And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see .,neutral
I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !,positive
"I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .",positive
This is too good to be true .,positive
"And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?",positive
"Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .",positive
"It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?",positive
We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .,positive
They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other !,positive
What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open !,positive
"Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big .",neutral
"It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ?",positive
With the shipping included--seventy dollars .,neutral
Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that .,neutral
But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment .,neutral
"Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge .",neutral
"Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ?",positive
This balcony is perfect for barbecuing .,positive
And we could get a dog !,positive
"I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish .",neutral
"Well , fish it will be then .",neutral
"Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ...",positive
"Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets .",neutral
Blow my nose ?,neutral
"Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster .",neutral
"No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater !",neutral
"It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it !",neutral
See ? That wasn't so bad .,neutral
Easy for you to say . My bottom still stings .,neutral
It might be sore for a while . You'll be OK . Now let's go home and rest .,neutral
Can't we go to McDonald's first ?,neutral
"No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice .",neutral
"No , thanks .",neutral
And vegetables with porridge .,neutral
Blah ... What's that ?,neutral
This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight .,neutral
"Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem .",neutral
Why is that ?,neutral
"Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home .",neutral
And the downstairs neighbors ?,neutral
"Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor .",neutral
Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then .,positive
"Morning , Mom .",neutral
I made a doctor's appointment for you .,neutral
"No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor .",neutral
Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school .,neutral
OK . I'll go see the doctor .,neutral
Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup .,neutral
Chicken soup again ?,neutral
"Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather .",neutral
"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .",neutral
But I don't have any reading assignments .,neutral
Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .,neutral
"Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .",negative
"You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .",neutral
Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup .,neutral
"OK , OK .",neutral
"And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again .",neutral
Maybe I'll run away first .,neutral
"Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine !",neutral
"Johnny , are you just sitting around again ?",neutral
I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet .,neutral
I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful !,negative
"I'm doing my best , Grandma ...",neutral
"Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty !",negative
"Uh-oh , here we go ...",neutral
"Johnny , I can't believe you would do that .",positive
"I know , Grandma , I just ...",neutral
"You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here !",negative
Yes'm .,neutral
You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !,negative
Yes'm .,neutral
And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !,negative
Yes'm .,neutral
"Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny .",positive
"It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson .",positive
And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ?,neutral
I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes !,neutral
"That's great . And the garbage , too ?",positive
"Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now .",neutral
Thanks for your help !,positive
I think I found my Yankee's mug ...,neutral
"Oh , great . Where was it ?",neutral
It fell out of the garbage bag .,neutral
What was it doing there ?,neutral
It was with all the other dishes from dinner .,neutral
You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ?,neutral
I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us .,neutral
"Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ?",neutral
Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?,neutral
No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ...,neutral
"Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ...",neutral
I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ?,neutral
Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !,positive
It's more violent than TV news !,positive
What time is it anyway ?,neutral
Nine-thirty .,neutral
"Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !",positive
No time . That's their headlights in the window !,neutral
"OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...",neutral
"Little dude , your life is over !",neutral
No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .,neutral
"Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma .",neutral
"Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here .",neutral
"She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all .",neutral
I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us .,neutral
"You know , maybe she's just a neat freak .",neutral
I think she just likes to make us miserable .,neutral
You could be right .,neutral
So can we play PlayStation later ?,neutral
"Sure , if you're done !",positive
"All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ?",neutral
"Well , listen , Honey , you've been a big help lately ...",neutral
Right on . I'm gonna get a new game !,neutral
"If you take out the garbage and do the dishes , I'll think about it .",neutral
I knew there would be a catch !,negative
"Nothing in life is free , Son .",neutral
"Except housework , that is .",negative
So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ?,neutral
"It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try .",positive
That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish .,positive
"Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten .",neutral
"I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ?",neutral
"There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it .",neutral
Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food .,positive
"Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice .",neutral
What about veggies ?,neutral
"They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal .",positive
It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait !,positive
"Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ?",neutral
"You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ?",neutral
"Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ?",neutral
Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor .,neutral
You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here !,neutral
"Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck .",neutral
"You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair .",neutral
"Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ?",neutral
"OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay .",neutral
"Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work .",neutral
"All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now .",neutral
"That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take .",neutral
"Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ?",neutral
That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead .,neutral
"I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan .",positive
"No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation .",positive
"Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later !",positive
"Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ?",neutral
"Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole .",neutral
"I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos .",negative
Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ?,neutral
Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili .,positive
Sounds good .,positive
Would you like anything to drink ?,neutral
"Sure , I ' ll have a Corona .",neutral
"Hi , I would like to return this TV .",neutral
"Sure , do you have the receipt ?",neutral
Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .,neutral
Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?,neutral
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .,neutral
"I see , and what about the keyboard ?",neutral
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .,neutral
"I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .",negative
Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .,negative
"Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ?",neutral
“ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ”,positive
"Trev , are you OK ?",neutral
Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records !,positive
Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing .,neutral
No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei .,neutral
"Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?",neutral
Sure ! What do you feel like having ?,positive
I really feel like having a big juicy steak !,positive
"Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?",neutral
I didn't know you were a vegetarian !,positive
"I'm not , I am a vegan .",neutral
A what ?,neutral
"A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .",neutral
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !,positive
"It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .",neutral
I found it at a garage sale once .,neutral
"What a find ! So , how much does it cost ?",positive
"Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks .",neutral
Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks .,neutral
"Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five .",neutral
Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ...,positive
"Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ?",neutral
"Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ?",neutral
Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ?,neutral
"Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming !",positive
"Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ...",neutral
... I know I'll be killed if I pee on the toilet seat .,neutral
And Steve is going to look after you until we come back .,neutral
Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old .,neutral
Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro .,neutral
"Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint .",neutral
No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places .,neutral
This is one of my favorite items .,positive
How did you get it ?,neutral
How much for these autographed Elvis records ?,neutral
Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks .,neutral
"Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ?",neutral
Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks .,positive
I don't really need five .,neutral
OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer .,neutral
"Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em .",neutral
Hello . Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself .,neutral
You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ?,neutral
My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry .,neutral
"Me , too . But I could never make bracelets like these .",neutral
I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars .,neutral
I'll take one right now for seven dollars .,neutral
It's a deal !,neutral
Why didn't you text me last night ?,neutral
What ? I sent you three or four messages !,positive
I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message .,neutral
Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages .,negative
"Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month .",neutral
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?,positive
"I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages .",neutral
No wonder you didn't get my texts !,neutral
"Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ?",neutral
"Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .",neutral
"Certainly sir , For which day and time please ?",neutral
Tonight at seven .,neutral
"I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .",negative
"In that case , eight o'clock is fine .",neutral
"Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?",neutral
Four people .,neutral
"Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?",neutral
Mark .,neutral
"I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat .",neutral
"Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street .",neutral
"I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae .",neutral
You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol .,neutral
Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind .,neutral
"It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on .",neutral
"How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet , let's order some hot dogs !",neutral
You are a lost cause .,neutral
"OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ?",neutral
"Almost , let me just put my apron on .",neutral
"OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit .",neutral
Got it .,neutral
No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing .,neutral
Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ?,neutral
"Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients .",neutral
"OK , so now we need a baking pan right ?",neutral
"Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes .",neutral
Done . So how long do we bake it for ?,neutral
We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan .,neutral
Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought !,positive
Hey honey ! Where were you ?,neutral
I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air .,neutral
How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ?,neutral
"It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit .",positive
Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox .,positive
"Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted !",neutral
You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore !,positive
What's for dinner ?,neutral
Leftovers .,neutral
What ? Leftovers of what and from when ?,positive
"From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches !",neutral
Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?,neutral
"Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius .",neutral
"Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning .",negative
"Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat !",positive
"Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night .",positive
Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .,positive
"Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math .",positive
"I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .",neutral
"Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot .",neutral
Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?,positive
"Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue .",neutral
"Oh yes , I ...",neutral
Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ?,neutral
"Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .",positive
Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?,positive
"No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?",neutral
We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?,neutral
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?,positive
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .,neutral
I'll just take a cheesecake .,neutral
Will that be all ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .,neutral
Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say .,neutral
"Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back .",positive
"Ok , so can I say , "" This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number "" .",neutral
"That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly .",neutral
"Ok , so how about this , "" This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! "" .",neutral
"A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , "" Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks "" .",neutral
That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ?,positive
"Look , Jimmy's report came today .",neutral
Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ?,neutral
"He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory .",positive
What about here in physical education ?,neutral
He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him .,neutral
So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F !,neutral
What did you cook ?,neutral
"Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes .",positive
Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?,positive
"Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !",positive
This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !,positive
Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .,positive
This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !,positive
"Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !",positive
"Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !",positive
Want some more ?,neutral
I'm stuffed !,neutral
What are you doing this weekend ?,neutral
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me .,neutral
Is it a family thing or just friends ?,neutral
"A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood .",neutral
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny .,neutral
Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife .,neutral
You mean your sister ?,neutral
"No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother .",neutral
You lost me .,neutral
"I'll explain later , let's go .",neutral
"Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ?",neutral
Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .,positive
"Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .",neutral
What about Rubella and Mumps ?,neutral
"Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .",neutral
"OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !",positive
"We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little .",neutral
Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online .,neutral
"Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?",positive
"Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .",neutral
"I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !",positive
"Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .",positive
"Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !",positive
"Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .",positive
Good idea !,positive
I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids .,neutral
What ? Why ?,positive
"Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .",neutral
Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .,neutral
"Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses .",neutral
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea .,neutral
I will bring it up over Sunday brunch .,neutral
Good luck with that !,positive
"Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ?",neutral
Here you go .,neutral
"I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .",negative
Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ?,positive
"We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight .",neutral
What's my other option ?,neutral
"Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning .",neutral
That's fine . I'll do that then .,neutral
Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now .,positive
What's wrong ?,neutral
"I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .",negative
You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .,neutral
"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .",neutral
"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" .",neutral
But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?,negative
"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .",neutral
"Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .",negative
"This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .",neutral
"Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .",neutral
"This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .",neutral
Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .,neutral
"Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all .",neutral
"Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring .",neutral
"OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ?",neutral
"Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi .",neutral
"Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course .",neutral
Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ?,neutral
"No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish .",neutral
"I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ?",neutral
"Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand .",neutral
Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ?,neutral
"That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay .",neutral
"Let's see . The label says it's got "" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . "" Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now .",neutral
"It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely .",neutral
All right . What varietal is that ?,neutral
"Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess .",neutral
And you think this is a good wine ?,neutral
"Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma .",neutral
Perfect ! I'll take it !,positive
Whoa ! This is a massive flea market !,positive
You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here .,positive
And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff .,positive
This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it !,positive
"You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan .",positive
"Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings !",positive
You want to go get a facial with me today ?,neutral
"Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that .",positive
"Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good .",neutral
True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ?,neutral
"Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks .",neutral
"That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day .",neutral
"Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it .",positive
Uh ... no .,neutral
Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !,positive
Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .,neutral
But you could have saved money .,neutral
"From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !",positive
"F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...",neutral
Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !,positive
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ?,neutral
"I can't , I have to go to the gym .",neutral
"Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !",neutral
"Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy .",neutral
"That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ?",neutral
"Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats .",neutral
Sounds like you are really getting in shape !,positive
Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much .,positive
Are you looking for anything else ?,neutral
"Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous .",positive
That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want .,neutral
"Really ? No , no , I couldn't ! You're too nice !",positive
And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them .,neutral
Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much .,positive
"Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?",neutral
Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .,positive
That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .,neutral
It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?,positive
"Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .",neutral
"Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?",neutral
Is fifteen dollars OK ?,neutral
"OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ?",neutral
"Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white .",neutral
Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long .,positive
What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ?,neutral
"I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle .",neutral
"Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ?",neutral
Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here .,neutral
"Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA .",neutral
Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ?,positive
OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food .,neutral
"You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes .",neutral
"Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good !",positive
How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun !,positive
"They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem .",positive
An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia .,positive
It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive .,neutral
"That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ?",neutral
"No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too .",neutral
"Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ?",neutral
"He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ...",positive

"How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ?",neutral
She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on .,neutral
Right . Cool ! Let's go !,neutral
"Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore .",neutral
"Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas .",neutral
"Show me some classic high heels , please .",neutral
"Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ?",neutral
Black . Classic .,neutral
"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone .",neutral
Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .,neutral
"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable .",neutral
"I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for .",neutral
What size ?,neutral
Seven-and-a-half .,neutral
Here we are . How does it fit ?,neutral
"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time .",neutral
"Have a nice day , Ma ’ am .",positive

By how much ?,neutral
I'll buy it for $ 2000 .,neutral
"I'm sorry , but the price is final .",negative
I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden !,positive

"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?",neutral
"Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools .",neutral
What type of tools ?,neutral
"You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe .",neutral
Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?,neutral
I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !,positive
"Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !",neutral
I'm planning on going to the market soon .,neutral
What are you buying ?,neutral
I don't know what we need .,neutral

Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?,positive
"Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .",neutral
Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .,positive
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !,neutral
"Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started !",positive
"Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color .",positive
"Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich .",positive
"Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil .",positive
"Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt !",positive
"That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time !",positive
"Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .",neutral
"Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .",neutral
How long does it take to get there ?,neutral
"About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .",neutral
"Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !",neutral
"Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .",neutral
Great ! I ’ ll take it .,positive

No ! Five minutes I promise !,neutral
Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !,negative
"Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .",neutral
Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !,negative
"What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...",negative
Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !,negative
"Honey , can you set the table ?",neutral

"Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this tricky section .",positive

It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad .,neutral
It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !,negative
"It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante .",neutral
Is that better ?,neutral
"Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ?",neutral
Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make .,negative
"That ’ s ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship .",neutral

"Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",negative

Have you treated any real emergencies ?,neutral
"Well , they took us along with some paramedics . There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense !",neutral

That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .,neutral
What does that mean ?,neutral
"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .",neutral
Me ! Me !,positive
"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs .

Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .,neutral

"Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ...",neutral
What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !,negative

"So , got any more ideas for the website ?",neutral
"Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room .",neutral

The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient .,neutral
You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things .,neutral

Any other ideas ?,neutral
We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments .,neutral

But what if I don't win what I bid on ?,neutral
Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap .,neutral
It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions .,neutral

Do you have this model in white ?,neutral

Then I'll take the yellow one .,neutral
Please wait a second . I'll get it for you .,neutral
Okay .,positive
What kind of car is best for me ?,neutral
"For you , I would recommend this one here .",neutral
The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ?,positive
"This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school .",neutral
That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ?,neutral
"This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical .",neutral
You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ?,neutral
"Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy .",neutral
"With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for .",neutral
"Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over .",neutral
"I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these .",neutral
"There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve .",neutral
Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off .,neutral
"Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help .",neutral
"Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ?",neutral
"Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan .",neutral
"An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ?",neutral
"You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen .",neutral
"So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ?",neutral
"You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system .",neutral
It sounds so complicated !,neutral
"No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops .",neutral
This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .,positive
"Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .",neutral
So it has attracted more and more customers these days .,neutral
"Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .",neutral
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !,neutral
Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .,neutral
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !,negative
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .,negative
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .,negative
Want to send out for some Chinese ?,neutral
Some what ?,neutral
"Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .",neutral
"No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?",neutral
"Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like .",neutral
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?,neutral
"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can ’ t finish what I ’ Ve ordered .",neutral
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .,neutral
Don ’ t worry . We ’ ll just get a doggie bag .,neutral
Excuse me ...,neutral
"Yes , sir . How may I be of service ?",neutral
I would like to return this item ... Are refunds allowed ?,neutral
"Certainly . The customer is always right , we are here to serve you . Is there a reason that you would like to return it ? Did you have problems with our product or services ?",neutral
"No , no ... It was just the wrong size .",neutral
Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size .,neutral
No . I would rather just return it .,neutral
"Sure , no problem . Do you happen to have the receipt ?",neutral
"Yeah , right here .",neutral
"Ok , just a moment , please . Here you are , I need you to sign here , please . And here is your refund . Is there anything else I can help you with ?",neutral

"It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ?",neutral
"There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway .",neutral
The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ...,positive
"No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro .",neutral
Is it expensive to ride on the underground ?,neutral
"You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go .",neutral
Is it easy to get lost ?,neutral
"No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way .",neutral
So how ’ s everything going for Christmas ?,neutral
"I ’ Ve got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That ’ s easy ; but I have another problem to deal with .",neutral
"What ’ s that ? Don ’ t tell me you ’ Ve still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours .",neutral
"No , I did that a long time ago . It ’ s about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus .",neutral
"He still doesn ’ t know that Santa isn ’ t real ? How old is he , eight ?",neutral
Yes . He ’ s never said anything so I never told him . But now that he ’ s getting older ...,neutral
You think it ’ s better that he should be told ?,neutral
"Yes , he ’ s too old to believe in that type of things . And I ’ d rather tell him before the kids at school do .",neutral
That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn ’ t real .,neutral
I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son .,neutral
"Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that .",neutral
"Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .",neutral
Do we have to ?,neutral
"Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .",neutral
"It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .",neutral
"A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .",neutral
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .,neutral
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .,negative
"I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .",neutral
"But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .",neutral
"I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .",neutral
"Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .",neutral
"Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .",neutral
"I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church .",neutral
How do you like this one ? It's nice and cheap It's only thirty-four dollars .,neutral

"It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .",neutral
"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .",neutral
"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .",neutral
"Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ?",neutral
I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles .,neutral
"I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes .",neutral
And what does your husband do ?,neutral
My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now .,neutral
"But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard .",neutral
"Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something .",neutral
Who finances the magazine ?,neutral
I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star .,neutral

I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?,neutral
Twice a week for work and once for shopping .,neutral
"In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .",neutral
"That's true . Ok , I will think about it .",positive
Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning .,neutral
Where did he go ?,neutral
"I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .",neutral
"Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .",positive
"Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .",neutral
"Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .",positive
"In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?",neutral
That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?,positive
That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you .,neutral

Where exactly did you use your passport in the store ?,neutral
In the shoe department . I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques .,neutral
"Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either .",negative
Then what shall I do ?,neutral
"You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it . These kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up .",neutral
You are right . Do you have a pen ?,neutral
Here you are .,neutral
"Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel .",neutral
"Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .",negative
"Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?",neutral

"Well , I am spending my vacation here and I have a stomachache and ...",neutral
"Oh , I see . Maybe we can fit you in at 3 .",neutral
"I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ...",neutral
"Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ?",neutral
"No , not for this country .",neutral
How about traveler's insurance ?,neutral
"No , I didn't think I ’ d need it .",neutral
"Can you pay cash , then ?",neutral
"Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain .",negative
"All right , all right , relax . I am only trying to do my job .",neutral
I know . I am sorry that I yelled at you .,negative

"Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ?",positive
I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ?,neutral
"Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side .",neutral
Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ?,neutral
"Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it .",neutral
"Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ?",neutral
"Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it .",neutral
"Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ?",neutral
"Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker .",neutral
All right . I guess I'll take a taxi then . How long will it take by taxi ?,neutral
Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi .,neutral
"Cool , thanks .",positive
You are welcome .,positive
"Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there .",neutral
We'd better see if he is ok .,neutral
"Sir , sir , are you all right , sir ?",neutral

I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .,neutral
"Sir , the curb here is not for parking .",neutral
"But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am .",neutral
"There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it .",neutral
I didn't see it .,neutral
"I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .",negative
My watch always gains ten minutes a day .,neutral
That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day .,neutral
No kidding .,neutral
"I am serious . Every morning I set my watch by the radio , but it still loses ten minutes .",neutral
You know what you can do ?,neutral
Throw it away and buy a new one .,neutral
"No , you don't have to . You only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day .",neutral
So you put your watch back ten minutes every day ?,positive
"Yes , that's what I am doing .",neutral

"I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style . Actually , I ’ m thinking about a perm . My sister is getting married next month . I think that if I have a perm now , I'll look very natural by then . What do you say ?",neutral
That's true . Here are some samples of hairstyles . What do you think about this one ?,neutral

"Well , I guess people who lived here before didn't clean the bathtub .",neutral
You ’ re darn right !,neutral
What should I do now ?,neutral
Don't worry . I ’ Ve got some acid here . It will help dissolve the hair down there .,neutral
Now you know you have to clean your bathtub every time when you use it .,neutral
Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here !,positive
"Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough .",neutral

"Well , I ’ m going to move out anyway . The new apartment has central air-conditioning .",neutral
"You should have moved out long , long ago .",neutral

"Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants .",neutral
Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ?,positive
"No , I need my books .",neutral
"Come on . If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy .",neutral
"Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less .",neutral
"Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt .",neutral
All right . That sounds fair .,positive
We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ?,neutral
Why ?,neutral
"Well , I think we could be saving more .",neutral
Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out .,positive
"Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month .",neutral
"That's 1,825 dollars .",neutral
We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account .,neutral
"3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 .",neutral
Right .,neutral
Where is my back pack ?,neutral
I don't know . Where did you leave it ?,neutral
"I just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone .",neutral
Are you sure ?,neutral
"Of course , I am sure . I bet someone stole it .",neutral

"No , thanks .",positive
"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?",neutral
"Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?",neutral
"Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .",neutral
I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .,neutral
"Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?",neutral
"Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?",positive
That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?,neutral
"Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .",neutral
"I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .",negative
"I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .",neutral
"Well , it's all new stock in the window now .",neutral
"May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?",neutral
"Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .",neutral
"Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .",neutral
"Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .",neutral
"Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .",positive
"That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .",neutral
"There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .",positive

I thought Henry usually did the conferences .,neutral
"Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ?",neutral
I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late .,neutral

You need a babysitter .,neutral

I could have Suzy stay at my place .,neutral
"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",neutral
Why not ?,neutral
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,neutral
"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",neutral
"I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .",neutral
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .,neutral
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .,positive
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .,neutral

"Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it .",neutral
Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ?,neutral

Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ?,neutral
No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .,neutral
Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ?,neutral
"Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago .",neutral
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .,neutral
"Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?",positive
"First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .",neutral
I see . What else ?,neutral
"We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .",neutral
"Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money .",neutral
"Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .",neutral
what do we need to get from the supermarket ?,neutral
"we need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer .",neutral
a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?,neutral
just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .,neutral
we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .,neutral
I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?,neutral
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .,neutral
"ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .",neutral
we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .,neutral
ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?,neutral
I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .,neutral
let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .,neutral
"I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go .",positive
"Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ?",neutral
Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now !,negative
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things .,neutral
Fine ! What do you need ?,negative
"OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s",neutral
"Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost !",neutral
"Never mind that.Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki.If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles .",neutral

Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute .,neutral
Welcome to the National Post . How may I help you ?,neutral
"Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well .",neutral
Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package .,neutral
How much is this going to cost ?,neutral
"Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ?",neutral
What ’ s the difference ?,neutral
"Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online .",neutral
"I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile .",neutral
have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ?,neutral
"no , I haven ’ t . I can ’ t think of anything to get him .",neutral
I ’ m having the same problem . I want to get something really special . Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts .,neutral
I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly !,positive
he bought me an iron .,neutral
that doesn ’ t sound like a great present .,neutral
"maybe not , but my iron was getting old . In fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . It ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working !",neutral
"let ’ s think . He loves football , doesn ’ t he ? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear . Let ’ s go and have a look . You know which team he supports , don ’ t you ?",neutral
"yes , I do . Let ’ s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic .",positive

"Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ?",neutral

"Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ?",neutral
"Yeah go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well .",neutral
I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner .,neutral
Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ?,neutral
They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there .,neutral
Oops !,positive
"in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people .",neutral
"maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they",neutral
"yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish",neutral
"then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people .",neutral
"well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea",neutral
"what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend",neutral
"well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink .",neutral

I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .,negative
Any idea when he might be back ?,neutral
"Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back .",neutral
"OK . well , tell him I've called , will you , and I'll try again later .",neutral
"All right . Goodbye , Dave .",positive
Thanks then Sally . Goodbye .,positive
pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?,neutral
"sure , here you are .",positive
"thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?",positive
"yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better .",neutral
"well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .",neutral
"Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u",neutral
"yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes .",neutral
"I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt .",neutral
"yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do .",neutral
exactly .,positive
"my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .",neutral
I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .,neutral
Do you know any places ?,neutral
well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .,neutral
thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .,positive
how much do are you looking to spend ?,neutral
"I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .",neutral
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .,neutral
"it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .",neutral
anything you need to have in the place ?,neutral
"I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .",neutral
you can also check out university bulletin boards .,neutral
why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?,neutral
"not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .",neutral
thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .,positive
good luck .,positive

you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .,neutral
let's see how much the bill is .,neutral
don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .,neutral
what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .,neutral
"no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .",neutral
"no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .",neutral
"alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .",neutral
"that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .",neutral

you've got a deal .,positive
great . Bye .,positive
bye .,positive
"Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?",neutral
"thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store .",positive
that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?,neutral
"yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off .",neutral
"true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .",neutral
"yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th",neutral
"yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w",neutral
that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .,neutral
"I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions .",neutral
"oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?",neutral
"it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria .",neutral

"Oh , a cat ? Come on .",positive
"yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small .",neutral
"but I think they're dull , aren't they ?",neutral
not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs .,neutral
"well , cats are certainly more independent .",neutral
"absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago .",neutral
"oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?",positive
yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it .,neutral
Poor cat .,neutral
now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special .,positive
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .,negative
"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?",neutral
"yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just",neutral
is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets,neutral
but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?,neutral

"when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .",neutral
maybe you have a point .,neutral
make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .,neutral

"that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .",neutral
"oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .",positive
"exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .",positive
why not try it on ?,neutral

I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home .,neutral

"my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?",neutral
an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones .,positive
"Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .",positive
"look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .",neutral
"that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .",positive
"that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .",neutral
"yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .",neutral
that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?,neutral
256MB .,neutral

I bought it online .,neutral
really ? Do you often shop online ?,neutral
yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online .,neutral
I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?,neutral

"and you can still go "" window shopping "" just like in a real shopping mall .",neutral

"Amy , you forgot another magic word .",neutral

You are very welcome .,positive
Do you think children watch too much tv ?,neutral
I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .,neutral
Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first .,neutral
"If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave .",neutral
They could go out and play with their friends .,neutral
Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .,neutral
Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too .,neutral
"That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .",positive
Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?,neutral
"Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c",neutral
How often do you run your anti-virus program ?,neutral
I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .,neutral
Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?,neutral
Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .,neutral
That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?,positive
Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .,neutral
What do you use your computer for ?,neutral
"I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you",neutral
"Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them .",positive
"I heard there is a big yard sale at weeks this saturday morning , i will go there to see if there is some nice clothes , do you want to go with me ?",neutral
"Well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , DVDs , and a lot of nice clothing , too .",neutral

Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .,positive
There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .,neutral
I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .,neutral
Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net .,positive
"When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?",neutral
"Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone .",neutral
"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .",neutral
"That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .",positive
That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time,neutral
How do I do that ?,neutral
"Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will",neutral
That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .,positive
How often do you use the internet ?,neutral
"I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?",neutral
Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor .,neutral
"So , you ’ re online eight hours a day .",neutral
"Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .",neutral
How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?,neutral
"I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .",neutral
How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ?,neutral
What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .,neutral
Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .,positive
"Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .",positive
Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?,neutral
"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !",neutral
That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?,positive
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .,neutral
"So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?",neutral
I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .,neutral
"I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a",neutral
"It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?",positive
You're finally here ! What took so long ?,positive
I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .,neutral
It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .,neutral
"I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .",neutral
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .,neutral
I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .,neutral
"It would be better for the environment , too .",neutral
I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .,neutral
Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .,neutral
The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .,neutral
"Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .",neutral
That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !,positive
"So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?",neutral
"Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .",neutral
"I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat .",neutral
Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .,neutral
Will you take long ?,neutral
No ! Five minutes I promise !,neutral
Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !,neutral
"Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq",positive
Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !,negative
"What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...",negative

"Yes , we do , there is a 90 percent for two .",neutral
"That is great , i will take this two , how much is that ?",neutral

Are you trying to lose weight ?,neutral
"Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles .",neutral
You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong .,neutral
"Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?",neutral
"Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors .",neutral
"So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ?",neutral
Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish .,positive

Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold !,negative

"So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?",neutral
"Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .",neutral
Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?,positive

"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone .",neutral
Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .,neutral
"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable .",neutral
I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly .,neutral
What size ?,neutral
Seven-and-a-half .,neutral
Here we are . How does it fit ?,neutral
"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo",neutral

"What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .",neutral
Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?,neutral
"We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .",neutral
Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !,neutral

I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden !,positive
What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening !,positive
"On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject .",neutral
"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?",neutral
"Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools .",neutral
What type of tools ?,neutral
"You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe .",neutral
Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?,neutral
I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !,neutral
"Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !",neutral
"Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals .",neutral
"No , thank you , I am not interested .",neutral

"I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .",neutral
"We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !",neutral
"Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ?",neutral
"Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !",positive
"Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications .",positive
"You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters !",neutral

"You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so",neutral
"Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have",neutral
"I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great",neutral
"Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go",positive

"I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files !",neutral
"But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus .",neutral
"Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems .",neutral
Ok . Anything else ?,neutral
"Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !",neutral
Um yeah.Sorry about that .,neutral
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !,positive
I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .,neutral
"Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it .",neutral
"I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .",neutral
"How do you mean "" suffer "" ?",neutral
"I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .",neutral
Even in the winter ?,neutral
"Yes , even in the winter .",neutral
"And even if it takes two hours , huh ?",neutral
Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !,positive
"Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .",neutral
Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !,positive
"I know . I can see that . This is what is called "" dim sum , "" right ?",neutral
"Yes , all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .",neutral
"So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?",neutral
Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .,positive
"And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .",neutral
No way !,neutral
What do you mean ?,neutral
"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .",neutral
"Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ?",neutral
"No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown .",neutral
Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?,neutral
"No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .",neutral
I wonder if you can cook things this good .,positive
I'm a great cook actually . You will see .,positive
Why don't you watch where you're going ?,neutral
Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !,positive
There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .,neutral
"Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .",negative
I think my arm is broken .,neutral
"Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .",neutral
"Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .",neutral
Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .,neutral
"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",neutral
Alright .,neutral
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,neutral
"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",positive
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,negative
"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",neutral
It really hurts .,neutral
"Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",neutral
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,negative
"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",neutral
To hell with you .,negative
Excuse me .,neutral
Yeah ?,neutral
I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ?,neutral
You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy .,neutral
"Yes , but ... well ...",neutral
What ?,neutral
How do I use the machines ?,neutral
What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers .,neutral
I see . Do the machines have soap in them ?,neutral
"No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ?",neutral
No . I don't have soap .,neutral
"Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there .",neutral
Thanks.Okay . I have my soap .,positive
My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ?,positive
I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean .,neutral
But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out .,neutral
Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before .,neutral
What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ?,neutral
No . Never .,neutral
I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ?,neutral
I'm nineteen .,neutral
But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ?,neutral
My mother always did it .,neutral
"Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself .",neutral
"I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it .",neutral
I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ?,neutral
What ?,neutral
"How are you going to survive here ? I mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.If you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.How can you live on your own ?",neutral
I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn .,neutral
"Well , I'll help you learn how to use these machines .",neutral
Thanks . My name's Nick .,positive
I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today .,neutral
"Thanks , Mom . Thanks .",positive
I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second .,neutral
This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now !,negative
"Alright , alright . I ’ m coming .",neutral
"Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted .",neutral
"You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .",neutral
Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?,neutral
"Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good !",positive
Great ! Can you set the table ?,positive
Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast .,neutral
Wait ! Don ’ t turn it on ...,neutral
"Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .",neutral
"Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?",positive
"Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .",neutral
"I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .",neutral
"But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .",neutral
"Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .",neutral
"Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .",negative
"Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ?",positive
"Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins .",neutral
Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?,positive
"Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up .",positive
"Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers .",positive
"You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !",positive
"You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ?",neutral
You ’ re so picky sometimes .,neutral
"Here you go , honey , fried eggs .",neutral
I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .,negative
I really appreciate your driving me around .,positive
"It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .",positive
It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .,neutral
So what do you see in there ?,neutral
This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .,neutral
Can you afford that much ?,neutral
"No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .",neutral
"Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .",neutral
How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?,neutral
That means the apartment has furniture in it .,neutral
That's good .,positive
"Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .",neutral
Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .,neutral
It's still pretty expensive .,neutral
"Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .",neutral
Alright . What's the phone number ?,neutral
256-7797 .,neutral
Got it . What else do you see ?,neutral
This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?,neutral
"No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom .",neutral
That sounds alright .,positive
"Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .",neutral
"Here's the number , 256-4367 .",neutral
Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .,neutral
Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .,positive
"Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ?",positive
Can I help you ?,neutral
"Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?",neutral
"Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?",neutral
Mostly cassette tapes .,neutral
Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .,neutral
Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .,positive
"It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .",neutral
I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .,neutral
Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?,positive
"Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .",neutral
"Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ?",neutral
"Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .",neutral
"Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .",neutral
How much is it ?,neutral
This one sells for $ 39.99 .,neutral
Can I test it out ?,neutral
Of course .,positive
It sounds great . I'll take it .,positive
Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment .,positive
Thanks .,positive
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .,neutral
What part hurts ?,neutral
The shoulder .,neutral
"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .",neutral
It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .,negative
C'mon . Just don't move .,neutral
I'm bleeding too much .,neutral
"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",neutral
"Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !",negative
"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",neutral
"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",neutral
Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,positive
"No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",negative
"Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?",neutral
"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !",negative
We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .,neutral
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .,neutral
"Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?",neutral
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .,neutral
"Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .",neutral
There . Stop !,neutral
"Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?",neutral
"Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .",negative
"Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?",neutral
We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .,neutral
Ok . I ’ ll take it .,neutral
Where would you like to sit ?,neutral
"Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .",neutral
Certainly .,positive
"Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I &",positive
NO !,neutral
I haven't even told you what it is yet !,neutral
"Okay , okay , what do you want ?",neutral
Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to concert tonight .,neutral
Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother .,neutral
"Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him !",negative
Who's this Eric guy ?,neutral
"Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please !",neutral
No can do ... sorry .,neutral
Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?,neutral
No way !,neutral
That ’ s so unfair !,negative
"Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ?",neutral

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !,neutral
Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .,neutral
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !,negative
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .,negative
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .,negative
Hello . May I help you ?,neutral
"Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ?",neutral
That one is one hundred and fifty dollars .,neutral
One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ?,neutral
That ’ s one hundred and forty .,neutral
Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ?,neutral
This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price .,neutral
"Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around .",neutral
"Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ?",neutral
That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ?,neutral
"Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both .",neutral
I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway .,neutral
my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer !,neutral
Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal !,positive
"I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from .",neutral
I would like to rent a car with a good stereo .,neutral
"All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us .",neutral
Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time .,positive
"Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot .",neutral
This is a Porsche !,positive
"Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ?",neutral
But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive .,negative
"Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars .",neutral
But how can you do that ?,neutral
"It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ?",neutral
"Yes , it almost looks new .",neutral
"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",neutral
Alright .,neutral
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,negative
"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",neutral
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,negative
"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",neutral
It really hurts .,neutral
"Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",neutral
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,negative
"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",neutral
To hell with you .,negative
"Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?",neutral
"Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .",neutral
"You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .",positive
Can I return the car in San Francisco ?,neutral
"San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .",neutral
Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .,positive
"No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .",neutral
"Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .",neutral
"Do you still want the car , sir ?",neutral
Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .,positive
It's a beautiful drive .,positive
Where are the keys ?,neutral

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !,negative
"I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .",neutral
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !,negative
I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?,neutral
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .,neutral
"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",neutral
I don't know .,neutral
"I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .",neutral
What do you mean ?,neutral
"We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",neutral
I have plenty of gas .,neutral
"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",neutral
So what can we do ?,neutral
"Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",neutral
Alright . That's a good idea .,positive
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .,neutral
Days ?,positive
"Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .",neutral
"Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .",neutral
Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .,neutral
"Okay , I'll follow your advice .",neutral
"Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?",neutral
umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday .,neutral

"Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ?",neutral
That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous .,neutral

"Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion .",neutral
"I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。",neutral
"There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .",positive
"I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me .",positive
Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .,neutral
Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time .,positive
What do you think this flat ?,neutral
It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us .,neutral
"Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think .",positive
"But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good .",neutral
"That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine .",neutral
"True , and I like the kitchen.It ' s new and well equipped .",neutral
It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .,positive
You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .,neutral
"May be we could get some new furniture , better stuff .",neutral
I haven't thought of that .,neutral
This apartment is wonderful .,positive
I ’ m glad you like it .,positive
How much would I have to pay for rent ?,neutral
The rent is $ 1050 each month .,neutral
That ’ s way too much money .,neutral
It isn ’ t too much .,neutral
How about if I pay $ 850 ?,neutral
I can ’ t take that .,neutral
I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 .,neutral
I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you .,neutral
You can ’ t go any lower than that ?,neutral
"If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal .",neutral
Do you like cooking ?,neutral
I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ?,positive
"I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .",neutral
You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .,neutral
So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .,neutral
"Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .",neutral
Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?,neutral
"Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .",neutral
How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?,neutral
"Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours .",neutral
I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please .,neutral
Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here .,neutral
"Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend .",neutral
"This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality .",neutral
"Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one .",positive
Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su,neutral
That ’ s fine . I would also like a few shirts and a jacket . I don ’ t need them specially made . Those shirts over there look very nice . Are they made of cotton ?,neutral
"Yes , they are . How many would you like and of which color ?",neutral
"I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please .",neutral
Are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ?,neutral
"Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card .",neutral
"Thank you very much , sir . I ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you .",positive
Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow .,positive
"May I speak to the apartment building manager , please ?",neutral
I'm the manager . How can I help you ?,neutral
I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available .,neutral
"Why , yes , it is . Would you like to get a look inside the apartment ?",neutral
"Yes , it would be nice to see the apartment .",neutral
How about today at 6 o'clock ?,neutral

Is there anything that I need to bring with me ?,neutral
No . I won't need to see anything except your driver's license .,positive
Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?,neutral
"Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .",neutral
"I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It's on sale , isn't it .",neutral
Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain .,neutral
I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?,neutral
Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?,neutral
It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters .,neutral
I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better .,neutral
OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .,neutral
This house is not looking all that great from here,neutral
You can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ’ s go inside .,neutral
I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here .,neutral
I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .,neutral
It is just too dark in here with so few windows .,neutral
I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ’ s go check it out .,neutral
"The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space .",neutral
The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better .,neutral
How many dogs live in this house ?,neutral
I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ’ s go look at another house .,neutral
"Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house !",neutral
It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside .,neutral
It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place .,neutral
"You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit .",neutral
"There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy .",neutral
Let ’ s go check out the kitchen . The printout says that it is quite large .,neutral
Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper .,neutral
"Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please .",neutral
What ’ s that smell ?,neutral
Perhaps we should move on to the next listing .,neutral
"Hi , can I speak with the apartment manager , please ?",neutral
"Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking .",neutral

"Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?",neutral
I used to live in that area .,neutral

That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?,positive
No . Just bring yourself .,neutral
How are you today ?,neutral
"Great , thanks .",positive

I haven't rented it out yet . Would you like to see it ?,neutral

"If you're interested , you can fill out an application form .",neutral
That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ?,positive
No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license .,positive
What are your thoughts on the apartment ?,neutral
I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .,positive
There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?,neutral
"I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .",neutral
What problems ?,neutral
I did notice a few stains in the carpet .,neutral
We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .,neutral
You will ?,neutral
"Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?",neutral
That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .,neutral
I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .,positive
It is . I love it .,positive
What do you think about the apartment so far ?,neutral
It is beautiful .,positive
You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ?,neutral
"Actually , there is a problem .",neutral
Like what ?,neutral
There are some stains that were left in the carpet .,neutral
Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in .,neutral
"Oh , is that right ?",neutral
Yes . Now what other problems do you have ?,neutral
That was the only problem that I saw .,neutral
"Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking .",positive
I honestly love it .,positive
How are you doing ?,neutral
Everything ’ s fine with me .,neutral
What can I do for you today ?,neutral
Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ?,neutral
"Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today .",negative
Why can ’ t I view it today ?,neutral
You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment .,neutral
I understand . May I make an appointment then ?,neutral
How does this Friday sound ?,neutral
Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect .,positive
That will be fine .,positive
Thanks for your help .,positive
Do you like the apartment ?,neutral
I absolutely love the apartment .,positive
Everything is okay ?,neutral
I do have one problem with the apartment .,neutral
What ’ s the problem ?,neutral
I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .,neutral
We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .,neutral
I did not know that .,neutral
"I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .",neutral
That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .,neutral
I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .,positive
It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .,positive
I would love to rent out your apartment .,neutral
That ’ s great .,positive
How much is the rent ?,neutral
The rent each month is $ 1050 .,neutral
That ’ s a lot of money .,neutral
Did you have a better price in mind ?,neutral
What about $ 800 ?,neutral
That ’ s way too low .,neutral
I can ’ t pay much more than that .,neutral
How about $ 900 a month ?,neutral
That would be fine .,positive
Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you .,positive
"I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .",neutral
"First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?",neutral
I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .,neutral
"I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .",neutral
Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?,neutral
"Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of .",neutral
Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?,neutral
You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .,neutral
What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?,neutral
There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .,neutral
What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ?,neutral
The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time .,neutral
What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ?,neutral
"You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name .",neutral
"There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning .",neutral
Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived .,neutral
I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in .,neutral
That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away .,positive
I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ?,neutral
"I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is !",positive
Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?,neutral
"Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ?",neutral
I never had a home inspection before .,neutral
I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through .,neutral
"I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house .",neutral
"The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future .",neutral
I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes .,neutral
"I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems .",neutral
What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?,neutral
"I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist .",neutral
What would be a good day to finally move into the house ?,neutral
You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you .,neutral
"Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ?",neutral
Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in .,neutral
"The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color .",neutral
An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in .,neutral
I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .,neutral
I think that will work out just fine . It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold .,neutral
Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in ?,neutral
My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day .,neutral
"Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager .",neutral
I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ?,neutral
I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available .,neutral
"Yes , it's still vacant . Are you interested in seeing it ?",neutral
"Yes , I would love to see the apartment .",neutral
I will be at the apartment today at 6,neutral
"Yes , I can be there at 6 .",neutral
Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ?,positive
"Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .",neutral
I'll be bringing an application form .,neutral
"OK , should I bring anything with me ?",neutral
"No . I might need to see your ID card , but that's about it .",neutral
I came in to see how my home inspection went .,neutral
"First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ?",neutral
"I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it .",neutral
I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it .,neutral
"The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month .",neutral
"Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken .",neutral
Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ?,neutral
"The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced .",neutral
Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ?,neutral
The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe .,neutral
When can I move into my new house ?,neutral
"The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday .",neutral
Will the utilities be turned on ?,neutral
You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name .,neutral
I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .,neutral
"If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in .",neutral
I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in .,neutral
"That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away .",positive
Can you help me on my move-in day ?,neutral
I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is .,neutral
"so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?",neutral
"yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .",neutral
That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .,neutral
yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .,neutral
Did you buy new cupboards too ?,neutral
"no , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .",neutral
I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .,neutral
"yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .",neutral
"I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please .",neutral
This is he . What can I do for you ?,neutral
I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street .,neutral
It's still available . Do you want to see it ?,neutral
"Yes , I would very much like to see it .",neutral
Does today at 6 p . m . sound okay to you ?,neutral
I have no problem with 6 p . m .,neutral
"Okay , I'll see you at 6 o'clock . Do you need any directions ?",neutral
"No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like .",positive
I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested .,neutral
Should I bring anything with me ?,neutral
No . I only need to check your driver's license .,neutral
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time .,neutral
"ok , what do you want me to do ?",neutral
"first of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish .",neutral
"ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .",neutral
we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .,neutral
"while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .",neutral
"actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .",positive
my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?,positive
yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .,neutral
keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .,neutral
I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ?,neutral
"That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room .",positive
I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe .,neutral
You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom .,neutral
"Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though .",neutral
Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store .,neutral
Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .,neutral
You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work .,neutral
That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .,positive
I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ?,neutral
I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ?,positive
I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .,neutral
new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table .,positive
do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?,neutral
that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ?,neutral
yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore .,neutral
I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be,neutral
"that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy .",positive
I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day .,neutral
ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes .,neutral
the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?,positive
I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys,neutral
"so , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam",neutral
"yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .",neutral
how long did it take you to do the tiling .,neutral
"as I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to information I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . The",neutral
I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?,positive
"you ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the information I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .",positive
Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?,neutral
"We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef.You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ?",neutral
"Yes , we do.We also eat a lot of lamb .",neutral
Yes . I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops .,neutral
That ’ s right.They taste so good.We eat them with mint sauce.Have you ever tried them ?,positive
"Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty.Can you cook them ?",neutral
"I certainly can.If I can get some from the butchers , I ’ ll cook them for you .",positive
That sounds great . I ’ ll boring a bottle of wine .,positive
What do we need for the barbecue ?,neutral
"Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties .",neutral
I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ?,positive
I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up .,neutral
"And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .",neutral
They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes .,neutral
I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce .,neutral
"I have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop .",neutral
How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ?,neutral
"It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked .",neutral
They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it .,neutral
I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians .,neutral
good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company .,neutral
excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .,positive
when did it first break down ?,neutral
about ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating .,neutral
"is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .",neutral
"yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high - pitch noise when it ’ s in use .",neutral
"ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes .",neutral
what ’ s wrong with it ?,neutral
part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily .,neutral
that ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?,positive
"Hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner.What would you like me to do ?",neutral
"Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it.First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler .",positive
"Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small.Wow , you can chop vegetables really quickly",neutral
"After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil.Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .",neutral
Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?,neutral
"These ones here.The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add .",neutral
"Yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons.of water.Ok , I ’ m really to do the meat.Should I cook it over a low flame ?",neutral
"Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly.Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan.Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan .",neutral
Right.What are you doing over there ?,neutral
I ’ m mixing the sauce.It ’ s my speciality . I make it according to my own secret recipe .,neutral
"Mom , I hate eating vegetables !",negative
You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .,neutral
"Thanks , Mom.Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake .",positive
No dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables .,neutral
But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair .,negative
"You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .",neutral
"Ok , actually I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots.But I hate broccoli and cauliflower .",neutral
"I'll remember that for next time.You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ?",neutral
"Thanks , Mom !",positive
What would you like for dessert ?,neutral
What do you have ?,neutral
"I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail .",neutral
Can I have apple pie with ice cream ?,neutral
"Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh .",positive
I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ?,positive

"Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed .",neutral
Do I have to get up now ?,neutral
"You'd better get up , or you'll be late .",neutral
What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .,neutral
"Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .",neutral
I must have slept right through it .,neutral
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !,neutral
